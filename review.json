The room was comfortable and updated, the spa service was excellent, I received a 2-for-1 buffet coupon on check-in and the location is incredibly convenient.\n\nHowever, the customer service left a lot to be desired, especially compared to similar hotels in Vegas.  For example:\n\n-The check-in process was ridiculously slow.  There were two desk clerks serving a line of about 13 couples on a Sunday night.\n\n- On check-in, I was told that the hotel was sold out and I could not be given the king, non-smoking room I'd asked for. I was given a double-queen room with a horrible view, on a low floor.  When I got into the room, it was still dirty - there were stains on both duvet covers, a couple of index cards with pictures of strippers on them, and ripped sheets on one bed.  I called the front desk and was promptly moved to a king, nonsmoking room on a high floor with a strip view.  Where was this room when I checked in?\n\n- When I called to ask for a shaving kit, I was told that \"TI does not offer this service.\"  Huh?? Holiday Inn offers that service!  As a result, I had to trudge down to the lobby to purchase a 30-cent BIC razor and a teaspoon of shaving cream for $5.95.  After paying a nightly resort fee that exceeds that of all the five-star hotels in Vegas, I was pretty annoyed to be nickle-and-dimed over toiletries.\n\n- The night before my departure, I called for late checkout, and was told that I had to call in the morning for late checkout.  I was checking out on a Wednesday.  I could have told the desk clerk that the hotel would not have been fully booked on a Wednesday.  \n\n- I had to wait 15 minutes for a casino host to even show up to sort out comps... and then the comps I was given were well below what competitors would have given.\n\nTI was certainly a great deal, but I do not recommend it for those seeking a high-end, luxurious Vegas experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_v6HIliEOn0l0YaAmBOrxw"}

I like the fried pickles w/ ranch!\n If you don't choose the Mac 'n Cheese as one of your sides... that's okay (more for me!), but you should.

Not so crazy about their green bean casserole... but others seem to be!  My friend (from SC) ordered the Brunswick Stew and said it was really good (and a little spicy too!)!  I'll try that myself soon... I'm sure!\nBeverages... of course they have whatever you might want, but for me... they have COPPER!!

I never had before, because I was too darned full!  But the friend I was with wanted something, so I followed along.  Let me tell you... the Banana Pudding was simply some of the best I've ever encountered.  Now I have a real problem - how to go back and NOT order it!  If you find yourself stuffed, order it anyway and take it home to eat later.\nThe only downside for this place is that parking can get a little short!

But I *love* Korean food and since Scotland has exactly two Korean restaurants I've been longing for this cuisine more than just about any other since I left San Francisco. \n\nI only noticed Shilla a few weeks ago, quietly tucked away in a basement on Dundas Street. Turns out they've been there for about three months (why do I never get these memos?!), but we only managed to stop in this past Friday. Down the stairs (and past a cheesy 70s-era animated painting) Shilla opens out into a rather expansive space with cheery murals and lots of nooks and crannies. The service is cheerful with big smiles all around and the clientele is disproportionately Asian, which we took to be a very good sign.\n\nAs is traditional in Korean restaurants, our starter was preceded by a few small simple vegetable dishes (I would normally call these collectively \"kim chi\" though our waitress referred to them as \"pantan\"): spinach, potato (very lightly curried), spicy tofy, and aubergine. \n\nOur starter was a \"gun man do\", essentially the same as Chinese pot sticker or Japanese gyoza: a pan-fried and steamed dumpling stuffed with pork. Very crispy on the bottom. The dumpling itself was a trifle bland, but this was made up for by the dipping sauce, salty and sweet with a strong taste of green onions.\n\nOur first main plate was \"bul go gi\", a plate of char-grilled marinated beef mixed with sesame seeds, cress, onions, peppers and mushrooms. It was served with lettuce leaves and a spicy sweet peanut sauce. One spreads the sauce and the meat on the leaves, then wraps them up and enjoys!\n\nSecond main was \"dol sot bi bim bap\" a (nearly) vegetarian delight of mixed veg (courgettes, bean sprouts, lettuce and carrot) over rice topped by a fried egg. A spicy sauce is served alongside, so that it can be mixed to taste. For us, this meant chucking it all in and mixing.\n\nWe also got a plate of \"proper\" kim chi, a glowing red plateful of spicy pickled cabbage.\n\nThe food was all good, most of it delicious. A slight downside was that we weren't drinking and had to keep asking for water. Also, the plastic table covering on some of the tables (including ours) looked cheap and denigrated otherwise lovely decor.\n\nThe menu includes Korean beer, wines, and soju (akin to Japanese saki).\n\nOut the door, our meal cost a bit less than \u00a330 for the two of us.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FDWo5X_XoBVCaro22r2sUw"}

My daughter at the age of two is an incredible fan of Mexican Rice and Beans and she wouldn't touch them here, she only ate the chips and salsa, which admittingly and disappointingly was the high-life of the mean.  I had the most order Pollo Fundido, the chicken (while all white meat) was extremely bland, the only thing that saved this dish was the jalapeno cheese sauce on top.  It actually had life and would make a great Con Queso dip in it's own rights.  I would like to see the meat livened up with a little jalapeno and salsa.

We've been here twice, and if I had posted a review after the first time, it would have been 4 stars.\n\n  We tried the short rib grilled cheese (good), the pot stickers (very good), the Fat Choy burger, & the PBBLT. Now, I consider myself a professional porker from the old school, but in order to be considered a contemporary \"foodie\", one has to venture out into the brave new world of exotica featured on the Food Network, and since \"pork belly\" and \"bacon\" are considered practically synonymous, I was actually anxious to give it a try. I am no longer anxious. It's not that it tastes bad, it's just that it's a little pork with a lot of creepy, greasy, mostly raw fat. How is it that the fat layers on bacon fry up crispy, chewy, and delightful, and this just seems like the stuff that would make you refuse to eat until your mother trimmed it off your meat for you? Yuck. Don't know what the fuss is about, but I'm not blaming it on Fat Choy. I assume this is the way it's supposed to be, and it's just not for me, along with blue-veined cheeses and anything with the word \"tartare\" in the title\n\n. Anyway, what we did have was hot and fresh, and the service was fine- one obviously experienced waitress named Tammi who was working like crazy and appeared to be training a younger one who seemed a little lost. All fine.\n\n However, we returned this week and had brunch. Dropping a star because the hollandaise on the Eggs benedict was salty, runny, and I expect pre-packaged, and the eggs were overdone. The potatoes on, the other hand, were golden, crispy, and delicious. Most everyone else's food was fine, but one poor Sad Sack ordered waffles, and they were so limp and pale you would believe they were cooked by an Englishman. They boil everything! However, it should be noted that the waffles we saw being served a little later to neighboring diners looked brown and toasty. So go ahead and order them, but first ask yourself if you feel lucky today\n\n. Added to this was the fact that they weren't that busy, Tammi was still plugging away, and the no-longer-new girl was still lost. While as a fan of The Walking Dead it was kind of fun watching her wandering around, bumping into walls with a vacant stare and a thin trickle of drool running down her chin, it was pretty much impossible to get a refill from her. Must have been hired for her looks. On the other hand, maybe not.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Kxp8cIMt3-vxwtCSsL9QKQ"}

The machines are incredible, and they aren't just pinball. There are about 20 OG arcade cabinets as well, like Paper Boy, Donkey Kong, Gauntlet and (my personal favorite) DRAGON QUEST!!

It probably takes 15 minutes to walk from our room to the pool or our room to the parking lot. The rooms were nice, but nowhere near as plush as the Wynn or even Red Rock.

You can buy a variety of ticket packages for these 3 rides. I opted for the $36 unlimited package.\n\nBig Shot: This is a free-fall style ride that involves sitting in a seat that is raised very quickly to the top of the tower and then  drops back suddently to the loading platform, giving you about 1 second of free fall. It repeats this procedure with a slightly less drastic fall a second time and then the ride is over. At least the line moves quick! I rode the ride 3 times in about 10 minutes.\n\nExscream: The ride was malfunctioning the day I was there, but even if it was working correctly, I have to imagine this line would take forever. The ride essentially involves sitting in a chair that is jerked to to the edge of a platform making you think you are about to fall off the edge of the tower, repeated a few times. The ride only makes sense from the front two seats.\n\nInsanity: This is a standard spinner ride, that just happens to be on the top of a very high tower. It is kind of boring actually, but the views are incredible.\n\nIn general I think Big Shot is the only ride worth doing unless you are insanely scared of heights.

It was like yoga but horrible, with a douchy instructor, a torture swing and nauseating tile floor.  I do not even know where to begin.  I went with a few friends and the instructor was well aware that we were new yet completely ignored us and stood there talking to her friends until class started instead of welcoming us or giving us any introduction to the swings.  Then for the one thing I couldnt do she stayed in her swing and watched me (the one time she looked back at the class at all) without offering me any instruction or assistance at all.  There is no one co-teaching to assist the people in the swings, only the instructor who is in her own swing doing her own thing, not even looking in the direction of the people in the class (good thing for her we all signed liability waivers), while you watch and do nothing and then attempt to do it yourself with no help.  After not being able to do the first exercise, I thought it would at least be a good hard workout, to which I was sadly mistaken.  It took 45 minutes to accomplish 20 crunches, 5 pushups, 5 lunges, and 1 leg stretch.  The entire rest of the time was spent getting in and out of the swing over and over again. It is also worth noting that the swings were extremely uncomfortable and every time you have to lean on them it hurts (unless there's a way to use them to avoid this, i wouldn't know thanks to no help from the teacher). The swings are also too close together even though there is plenty of unused space in the giant room, so I hope you enjoy a mouthful of the stranger in front of you's feet.   \n\nThen after all the hype about making you sign up for class on their pain in the ass website to reserve yourself a horribly uncomfortable swing and ensure there is a space for you, i got up for water and some girl took my swing!  the instructor said nothing and i had no more swing to use halfway through the class. Pissed off as I was, this was probably a good thing, I think the swing thief did me a favor since at that point i wanted to throw up from the combination of swinging back and forth and staring at their nauseating black and white alternating tile floor!!! the instructor said nothing to the girl who took my swing or me as i stood there for five minutes watching everyone else practice, so i walked out and she continued to say nothing and let me go. good riddance you crappy studio, i want my money back!

We just couldn't resist the sweet potato fries. We walked in knowing that was a done deal and also saw that by checking in on yelp we were rewarded with chili cheese fries as well. While deciding on what else we wanted we were lucky to meet Jim who I am assuming is the owner along with his wife. I introduced myself and chatted for a few minutes and told him how I had made review of the day and thanked him for such great tasting food. I am upping them one star because even though they lack seating they make up for it with the passion they put in their lovely, little eats. Maybe I shouldn't say little though because for pricing their portions are fairly large and very filling. The sauces have so much flavor and everything just taste so fresh and made to order. Just look at my pictures if you don't believe me. go...i dare you. don't worry...i'll wait. :)\nNow while debating between jalapeno mac and cheese or fried ravioli's the boyfriend and I opted for the small jalapeno macaroni. After all I did say in my last review how when I went back that it was a must. Our total for 3 pieces came to only $6.46 after tax. (remember we checked in to score free chili cheese fries though. saving us $2.99.) We were told it would be a few minutes so we just took up some seats and chatted. I noticed how they both went and washed their hands right after doing business with us and our money before preparing our food. Cleanliness is always a huge plus in my books. After about 7 or 8 minutes our food was ready and in the plastic bag and to our surprise they gave us some free fried raviolis!\nThe sweet potato fries were just as I remembered and are still some of my favorite in the valley. The jalapeno mac and cheese was so creamy with just the right amount of spice and left a nice little kick in my mouth afterwards. i love the way mom's good eats spices and sauces linger in my mouth. keeps me wanting more! the fried raviolis were crispy on the outside and soft, melt in your mouth, on the inside. the marinara sauce has something addicting in it because i could have licked that little container clean! what is your secret?? the chili cheese fries were just how i like them...huge and sloppy. chili everywhere. cheese everywhere. i tried to go at them with my fingers, but i needed a fork. that container of them lasted me until today. which was good because i woke up craving them.\nOnly two times there and I am hooked on mom's good eats and can't wait to make the drive up to Durango again for their \"good eats!\"\nGreat service, great prices, great portions, and not to mention great food. a 5 star quick eats in my book.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bPX-yR2hEYK1gdvw045YQ"}

She said it was awesome and I didn't even question what was served there.  An CMYE was setup and I was looking forward to try out this place as well as meeting a couple of travelling Yelpers.  I showed up to this diner which has limited seating and tried to get a seat for 10.  I can guarantee you that won't happen; also I don't think they take reservations :)\n\nOther Yelpers started rolling in and people started leaving.  The staff here is pretty awesome and started seating us based on the space that opened up.  We were scattered throughout this place!  I sat down ordered a coffee and had a quick look through the menu.  I couldn't decide what to go so ended up getting 2 meals (huevos rancheros and Gros Jambon dog), which I didn't finish but split between me and my awesome brunch partner.\n\nThe huevos was solid and had a chorizo patty in between the egg and the toast.  The dog though was awesome.  It's just a hot dog with tomato, cucumber and this delicious spicy mayo.  I'm glad I ordered both meals though it wasn't finished but they packed it up for us to go.  I had some of the fried chicken and waffles as I was swapping food with my brunch partner and that was also good!  I don't think you can go wrong here, though I heard the Coke burger was OK but I didn't get a chance to try it myself.\n\nThe diner doesn't look like it holds 20 people so you'll more than likely have to wait when you arrive but check it out, it's pretty damn delicious and a bit different than a lot of places you might be able to grab brunch downtown.  There are no tables here and you'll be seated at a bench or long one sided table.

I chose the chicken with sesame sauce, but the non-soup version. The noodle puller, as I like to call him, emerged from the kitchen ready for some serious action. After giving me a rather serious 'don't mess with me' look, he proceed to yank the sh*t out of the noodles, then slammed the hell out of them. Repeatedly. It's a rather noisy and somewhat aggressive process and I can only hope that the noodle-puller achieved satisfaction from the physical exertion of the task. \n\nThe non-soup was served in a to-go bowl, with the noodles on the bottom, shredded chicken and baby Bok Choy on the top, and of course, the sesame sauce. The first thing I tried was the chicken - it was all breast, just the way I like it, with not a hint of pink anywhere to be found. Though a little salty, I really enjoyed the chicken. It was tender and seemed fresh. I had to forgo the Bok Choy because no amount of cutting (or attempts at) seemed to work. I just couldn't chop through the damn leaves. They were so pretty and green, too. Anyway, I then got a taste of the noodles in sesame sauce. The sauce was  quite nice but tasted more like the peanut sauce you would find with peanut butter dumplings. The noodles were good though I did find them to be a bit on the starchy side. Also, they really should cut these things in half so I can get them on my fork more easily. The overall dish was very good, though I will hold that 4th star for a retry - this time in soup format, as the noodles are meant to be eaten.\n\nService: This is where I docked a star. The chick at the counter wasn't friendly at all and I felt like I was bothering her. Never mind that it was 2pm and there was no one else there. The noodle puller wasn't friendly either. It was one of those places that made me want to get my noodles and get the hell out of there, perhaps to a sunnier side of the food court.\n\nPrice: Under $10, and the noodles are pretty filling.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8ZHlBxTaIWuErGpGsOoeHw"}

Workout equipment on either end with hand weights and tv's. \n\nWhile I know that private gyms can be more equipped and fancier, I have to give this little gym a lot of props. It's got a good variety of equipment, not overly known so isn't always super busy, and the price is more than reasonable ($15/month).

The 'cowboy caviar' [black beans and a mild salsa mix] was different, but refreshing. The nachos also were huge, as a proper appetizer [not something to fill you up, but satiated] can feed 3. \n\nNext we ordered the rib bones [4 ribs in a bowl].

Pretty fatty, I ended up with half the meat sitting on my plate because I don't like really fatty meat in general. But that's ribs, you know?\n\nWe also had a half order of steak fries. They are served up deep fried with a sweet and spicy jam on the side. I loved these. Real greasy, real freaking good. The steak was way tender.\n\nThe unanimous favorite were the sliders.

It can be problematic to visit a place like Au Pied de Cochon that is so heavily hyped and known by foodies. How can any meal live up to the expectations? Our meal was solid with some delights and slight disappointments.\n\nWe booked four weeks out. Arriving on foot, we walked right by the place, as there is no sign (I like that).  We arrived at our appointed hour, but had to wait another half hour. For part of the wait, we were given a seat at the counter with a direct view of the controlled chaos of the open kitchen. The brigade was dressed in dark blue Dickies workshirts with name patches like one find at a garage. They were working feverishly. I noted the fry station seemed to be holding items longer than is best for freshness, something we would experience firsthand. While quaffing a local beer (St. Ambroise Pale Ale) we watched the different dishes coming out of the kitchen and started to formulate a plan.\n\nOnce at the table, we decided to order more items but split them. We ordered the famed poutine with foie gras, a tomato tart, fried zucchini blossoms (with the small zucchini attached), the PDC's melting pot. Half of the dishes were okay and half were excellent. The poutine was luke-warm, had just a few fries and the foie gras was not of the highest grade, having a fairly coarse texture. The blossoms were thickly battered, not the tempura batter that we had expected. They were also pretty greasy. The tomato tart was fresh and perfectly crafted: a good counterpoint to heavy food. The PDC's melting pot was the star with four kinds of pork plus roasted mushrooms and onions on a bed of mashed potatoes, which ended up being aligot: Auvergne style (cheese enriched) mashed potatoes all in a cocotte. Our favorite cut was the pork belly, but all were exemplary and we enjoyed the variety. Several tables had the pig's head for two, which I am sure was tasty, but my wife was not really up for the visuals for us to order it.\n\nA table of four sat near us, which provided considerable humor. Two couples of asian gangstas talked up a storm of stupidity. The guys tried to impress the women who were preoccupied with playing video games on their phones. They ordered a bottle of wine which they promptly sent back stating it was \"sour\" (not big fans of acidity, I guess, which might have helped them enjoy their heavy meal). Behind them, a Japanese couple spent the entire time fiddling with their iPhones while eating: never talking with each other.\n\nWe ordered poached pear with vanilla ice cream and a cappuccino. The poached dessert was perfection, but the cappuccino was nasty. Super darkly roasted espresso, no steamed milk and a cap of fluffy dry foam.\n\nIn summary, it was a good meal with ups and downs. It was not the finest pork dish nor the best foie gras I have ever tasted, but it may have been an off night. To their great credit, the prices are shockingly reasonable. Given the crushing popularity, they could charge twice as much and still pack them in.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KKucN3P6aH84MCfPr56a8g"}

Pouring a pitcher of beer from the tap, then setting an ice-cold glass in front of me, she offered up a menu.\n\nWhile the 30-year-old eatery in Phoenix is showing its age, the attitude is laid back and super friendly.\n\nThe Original Hamburger Works has two dining rooms, the bar and a more family-friendly space. The taste is decidedly kitschy, with walls covered in vintage signs, sporting memorabilia and chotchkies galore. The atmosphere is fun. Large tables can accommodate big groups. Orders are placed and paid for at the counter. In the bar, orders are taken by the bartender.\n\nLike a campfire, there is something mouthwatering about the strong smell of mesquite wood smoke emanating from the kitchen. You can tell from watching the cooks manhandle slabs of meat over an open flame that the burgers here are treated right.\n\nThe centerpiece of the dining room is a wagon filled with fresh-sliced tomatoes, lettuce, onions and pickles and condiments and salad dressings. You are in control of your burger destiny with as many ladles of ranch dressing as you'd like. I'd recommend not going too heavy on the condiments and toppings; the burgers here can stand on their own.\n\nBiting into the Big One ($4.09) gives new meaning to the whimsical saying. A deep amber charbroiled crust surrounds the 1/3 pound of fresh ground beef, inside it's perfectly medium, as ordered. The meat is toothsome, well seasoned and bursting with a wonderful beefy caramelized flavor.\n\nPotatoes, aka fries ($1.79), were disappointingly pale and seemingly unsalted. I'd opt for the Onion Rings ($2.69), fried golden brown and addictive with dunks into ranch dressing.\n\nIf you don't eat red meat you're in luck, they make a juicy Chicken Sandwich ($5.09). Cooked over the same mesquite coals, this sandwich has a surprising amount of satisfying heft. The Italian version gets a treatment of flavor, adding Italian dressing before getting cooked to a savory finish.\n\nFair warning: When eating Buffalo Wings (nine pieces for $5.95) don't wear a nice shirt. These are so sloppy that you may need a stack of wet-naps to get through the plate, but exactly how they should be.\n\nThe Original Hamburger Works might be a little bit country, but the burgers are a whole lot of rock 'n roll.", "type": "review", "business_id": "N_6bV3c3JagKW7sD3X9ldA"}

If you are going to try it based on hearing \"it's the best buffet in Las Vegas\" do lunch at around 2:30 pm.  (Lunch time pricing ends at 3:00pm) It is not worth more than $38.00.. I went for the seafood.  The quality is not up to standard. There was no king crab leg, and the large crab legs they put out on the seafood cold bar for dinner (Switchover is around 3:30 where they put out more items for the dinner bar) The crab legs were skimpy and FROZEN, not thawed out. (Maybe that was punishment for budget conscious people trying to get a dinner buffet, at a lunch time price, because they might be thawed out by 8pm for the mid dinner crowd. The crab legs that were a little thawed out were waterlogged.  The \"shrimp cocktail\" was yellowish, and waterlogged as well.  The mussels were not fresh, and the salmon was not fresh. The buffet (with the exception of the meat counter) had a hard time keeping the hot food from being cold thus the food is not maintaining the right temperature, which might be the reason people reported getting sick from the buffet in other reviews. From the time I got from the buffet, to my table, my pork ribs were cold.  They give you this rubber grabber for getting your dishes, as they warn you the dishes are hot, but I never used that thing. Dear Bacchanal Manager-- Save money, from buying those things and invest in the seafood part of the bar. As far as the desserts go, they are cute, but tasteless, with the exception of this dark chocolate mini cake with a raspberry on top, the fruit toppings and the creme brulee was good. My first experience of gelato was in Italy, so this gelato paled in comparison. The prime rib was the best thing on the bar, so I got my money worth on that and the sushi rolls were decent.  Save yourself some money, and do not pay extra for this buffet, it's not worth it.

As the restaurant is small and tables are cramped close to each other so seating is very uncomfortable and navigating to and from the buffet is painful as you void bumping into other diners.\n\nThe dishes were standard fare that you will find in any Indian buffet. The appetizers included tandoori chicken, samosa and some fried potato dish. Butter chicken, saag, chili chicken and mutton curry were entrees. Then there was steamed rice and dal and lastly gulab jamun and sweet rice for desert.\n\nTaste wise what stood out to me was that every dish was bad. Not just one or two items but everything that I ate was the text book definition of bad Indian food. Tandoori chicken seemed to be boiled and then doused with a lot of color as it lacked any flavor at all and was stone cold. The samosa seemed to be undercooked. The pan fried potato were limp and seemed to be days old. The butter chicken was barely edible. Chili chicken tasted gross and the goat in the mutton curry was undercooked so was chewy (not one person in our entire group could eat the goat). The naan provided at the table was thin and overcooked so it felt like a crispy flatbread. We asked for garlic naan which was better but it came at the fag end of the meal so it was almost useless. The gulab jamun was one of the worst that I'd ever had and the sweet rice was forgettable. I also noticed that there was no biryani in this buffet.\n\nService was also slow. As mentioned garlic naan was provided at the end of the meal. Plates were not cleared quickly so we ended up stacking them in one corner which made the small table feel even more cramped. Even stacked plates did not prompt quick service and at one time we were scared that the plates would topple over and cause a mess but that did not deter our servers from ignoring them.\n\nAt the end of the meal I was happy to be out of this small, cramped, claustrophobic place with terrible food. A sentiment echoed by each and every member of our group that ate here.\n\nPrice wise it was $10.99 which is typical for Indian buffet's but what I can't get is the high ratings for this place. unfortunately another Indian restaurant that did not live up to its sky high ratings. Obviously won't make the mistake of returning again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "D_BMUHbZk67hzRcK3xQQmg"}

My fiance and I arrived right around 8:30 PM to a completely empty restaurant.  The downstairs of the restaurant is a bar area with a couple of tables that can only seat three people.  As I looked around a little worried about the seating situation, our server came out and asked how many?  Whenever we replied with 4 she pointed to some stairs and said that we could sit upstairs.  Since she didn't come with us we were free to seat ourselves wherever we wanted.  The upstairs of this place is actually quite nice and reminded me of a room used to host nice parties.  There were white table clothes on all of the tables along with white chair covers and black bows.  The only oddity was the flat screen TV on one of the walls which had on a foreign station (Uzbecki perhaps?) playing music videos.  While it seemed a bit odd at first, everyone eventually ended up enjoying the music.\n\nSince none of us had ever had Uzbek halal before the table decided to split a couple of appetizers to start off with.  We went with the eggplant roll, julien in pancake bags and finally a double order of the homemade bread.  Both the eggplant roll and julien in pancake bags come out together before our meals.  We were actually debating about whether we should order the pancake bags or something else whenever we had placed our order but after it arrived we were more than happy to have to stuck with our decision since it was delicious.  It did indeed look like a pancake bag whenever it arrived at our table and seemed to have the consistency of Injera.  The inside of the bag was filled with mushroom, beef and a creamy sauce all of which was delicious.  Meanwhile the eggplant roll consisted of some eggplant rolled up around tomato and garlic with dill on it.  It was decent but paled in comparison to the bags.  For my entree I went with the Kavsar (You can't go wrong ordering a restaurants namesake, right?) while my fiance went with the Gampam and our dining companions went with Chuchvara and Lagman with each couple also ordering a lamb kabob.  It was nice to see all of the different dishes whenever they arrived at the table with the double order of homemade bread.  The kavsar is roasted meat sausage rolled with whipped eggs and cheese steamed with some bell peppers and I choose mashed potatoes as my side.  It ended up having a pretty good flavor and it reminded me quite a bit of stuffed cabbage with the cheese and egg taking the place of the cabbage.  I was also able to taste both my fiances Gampam(rice topped with rich and delicious broth with vegetables, asian spices and beef tender loin) and our friends Chuchvara (handmade small boiled dumplings filled with ground beef and chopped onions) with the spices in the Gampam making it my favorite of the three entrees I tried.  The kabob was also excellent and sort of reminded me of peppered beef jerky.  That's not a bad thing in my book though as I do love that flavor.  The homemade bread was also really good with a unique shape and a good thick crust around it and a soft inner filling.  Finally for dessert my fiance and I ended up splitting the dessert of the day which was a honey cake.  The server was unable to describe it to us but being adventuous, we ordered it anyways.  I would describe it as a multi layered sponge cake with a strong taste of honey in the frosting and both my fiance and I thought that it tasted pretty good.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  The restaurant itself ended up looking pretty good inside, our server was nice and all of the food was had was both different and good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Cbjk9o7sey49xnv_geotww"}

I had SUCH a fun time at this show.  I went with my mother (which had the potential to be extremely embarrassing, but it was actually a lot of fun), and we both had a blast.\n\nWe went on a Tuesday night, so it was a little slow.  The room wasn't filled up, but it wasn't completely dead either.  The montage of TV clips at the beginning did drag on a bit too long, but that's as close of a complaint as you're going to get from me ;)  Towards the beginning, the host asked for three adventurous ladies to come up on stage.  I raised my hand, even though I'm hardly the adventurous type.  Thank GOD he didn't choose me, because (SPOILER ALERT) it ended up being a \"fake orgasm\" contest!  I would've died of embarrassment.  It ended up being rather funny, but only because it wasn't me doing it.\n\nAs for the show itself - okay, they're not the best of dancers.  Who cares?  I didn't come to see Riverdance, I came to see a bunch of hot guys!  And on that front, they did NOT disappoint.  Whew.  And the host surprised me the most when he stripped - I had NO idea all those muscles were under those clothes!  All of the guys were just drop-dead gorgeous.  My favorites were the Hughes brothers, Adam and Dave (the blonde one).  They look nothing alike, but they're both sexy as hell.  And the youngest one of the group, also named Dave (last name Harris), is quite the dancer.  He's adorable and has a slight resemblance to Justin Timberlake, only with way more muscles.\n\nAt the end you could go up and pay $20 for a picture with them - and it was by far the best $20 I've ever spent ;)  Seriously, if I'm having a bad day, I can just look at this picture and a goofy grin comes to my face.  When I went up there, Dave (the blonde one) said, \"oh, you're really pretty, come sit on MY lap.\"  I just giggled and said okay... I wasn't about to complain.  He gave me a kiss on the cheek. (I'd like to point out here that I immediately reverted back to being a 13 year old girl.)  After the picture was taken, Adam came around and gave me a big hug, and Dave Harris (the dancer) asked me where I was from.  I told them Florida, and that I had studied abroad in Perth.  They thought that was neat :)  As I collected my picture, Donovan (the \"wild child\" as they called him) told me I was really pretty and gave me a hug.  I know they're paid to do it, but man, do they ever know how to make a girl feel good about herself! ;)", "type": "review", "business_id": "b4lcgZ1ItuTjGGZmkLa2BQ"}

I've been dying to give this place a try because I pass by it frequently.

I ordered:\n\nPickled Cucumber Salad\nPork Potstickers\nOrange Chicken\nFried Rice\n\nMy order totaled $12.95 for those selections, which is a pretty good deal considering the amount of food you get.\n\nThe Pickled Cucumber Salad was pretty good....it's very sweet and has a little sour flavor to it.  A nice start for lunch.\n\nThe Pork Potstickers were just OK.  They were kind of hard on the edges, which means they were left out under a heat lamp too long.\n\nThe Orange Chicken was OK....very sweet.  The Fried Rice was very good....it helped to lessen the sweetness of the Orange Chicken, so it complimented it very well.\n\nOverall, it was an average lunch.

It was a large portion which I saved half of for lunch the next day. the noodles had a perfect texture and the vegetables mixed in were tasty.  I usually would never order a vegetarian dish, but this was phenomenal.  Great reheat factor and reasonably priced at $8.99. The chicken in the GT was very tender and juicy.

Made with their corned beef cut into strips and tossed with red onions, brown onions, and green onions, this corned beef hash was excellent.\nThe 2nd platter was a bacon avocado scramble and this was delicious.

The room was not as nice as rooms I've seen at the Encore or MGM, but again, for a bed and shower in a nonsmoking room, it was just fine.\n\nThe MG tower is fairly close to the monorail, which worked well for me. It limits the amount of walk-through-the-casino time, which also works well for me.\n\nOne gripe: Harrah's promotes its lack of a resort fee, but Internet access costs about $12/day -- that's included in the resort fee at the TI, for example -- and the health club costs $10-$20/day. So, I guess if you're not planning on exercising or getting online, the lack of a resort fee is a good deal.

I ordered:\n-caesar salad\n- side: half chips, half onion strings\n- filet tenderloins (cooked perfectly)\n- a flourless chocolate cake, which was thick & gooey (I rarely order chocolate cake, but the only other option for me was cheesecake & I definitely don't love cheesecake.) \n- I stole a few bites of my bf's key lime pie which was equally tart & sweet.\n- crab cake appetizer ($20. my favorite crab cake of all the crab cakes I've tasted because they use lump crab meat.)\n\nOur server was friendly & checked on us often. The busgirl (is that what you call a female busboy?!) was a little too chummy with my bf but that's ok...i understand, a girl's gotta work it for her tips! We ate on the patio where we could people watch. I am definitely a fan of the Palm!", "type": "review", "business_id": "5IWu0xhlZEopvIz3w7o_3w"}

WE ARE NEVER MOVING, OKAY HONEY? NE-VER!\"\n\nThis was no exaggeration. If you've read my Southpark Nordie's review, you'll know I'm a fan of their customer-service oriented culture. Now slash prices by 30-percent or more on a daily basis, you've got yourself a retail party. \n\nI should preface this review by saying yes.  It is indeed hit-or-miss like a TJ Maxx or Marshalls store. The inventory can be pretty random. But your odds of finding something fabulous for a good deal are way higher than these discount chains.  \n\nIn addition to past season items, some is overstock from actual Nordstrom retail stores.  I've seen bras and loungewear selling for $78 at the Southpark store, selling for $24 at the Rack.  I found a $300 cashmere Milly cardigan from a past season for $80.  A Dolce Gabanna denim skirt I would never pay $265 for, at just $49. (Prices are approximate since I don't remember the exact dollar amount, but you get my drift.) A Lucy brand workout tank I bought for my sister-in-law for about $50 at the real Lucy store was a crazy cheap $8.\n\nThe customer service here is also on-par with the \"real\" store.  For our wedding, my husband needed 10 pairs of brown loafers for his family members and groomsmen.  To keep their costs low, we went to the Rack and found the perfect pair of comfy cognac leather loafers for $49 each.  There were only a few pairs in the sizes we needed, so our sales associate spent over an HOUR after the store closed, calling other Nordstrom Racks across the country, to locate the sizes we needed, and to ship them out. \n\nTIP #1: To those who say it's hit-or-miss because they can't find an item in your size-- have your SA call around and find the item in the Rack nationwide system.  He or she can ship it to you at a small cost. (Or no cost for Nordstrom debit or credit card holders of a certain level.) \n\nTIP #2: Stay away from the beauty section for good deals.  The prices there aren't really a great deal.  This is the only section where the prices for Bliss Spa, Stila Cosmetics, H20 are about the same as retail. \n\nTIP #3: Nordstrom Rack has a tailor on-premises, just like the real store, so if you need something hemmed, try getting it done at the store.  All their alterations people do great work. \n\nTIP #4: Rack items go on clearance after a few weeks. Don't miss out on these racks!", "type": "review", "business_id": "xzy1VOKGmn4QHmy6DWZ3PA"}

First they give you a corn thing almost like a pudding, but it was sweet and a nice touch. We were also given small bread puffs that were delicious! I had the souffl\u00e9 which was really good. It was a little bit hard at the bottom, seemed like a croissant type of thing. I really loved the top though, very light and delicious. The egg popped just perfectly over it all. It doesn't look very big but it was quite filling! Boyfriend had eggs Benedict. That was pretty good too, but how can that be bad at a high class restaurant? I had a strawberry lemonade that tasted like strawberries crushed in my cup. It was very strong and not very watery so it was gone real fast. I would not order that again... not worth 7 bucks.\n\nAt the end, we had some chocolate flutes rolled in powdered sugar and they weren't too sweet with dark chocolate on the inside.

The large menu was easy to read, and each item listed what was included, price and calorie count. \n\nWe were there on a Sunday around lunchtime and had little to no wait. We ordered after asking a few questions. The cashier was patient and knowledgeable. We were given a buzzer to indicate when our food was ready.\n\nThere were two dining areas and a large patio. There was a condiment station that looked like a small salad bar, two of the new computerized coke machines along with a bakery area. We were headed out to the patio when we noticed two homeless men with shopping carts. Okay, back inside....found a table inside instead.\n\nI ordered the blackened tilapia with a lettuce wrap. My friend ordered a bacon burger. Our food came up fairly quick. The tilapia looked amazing! Two filets on lettuce topped with blue cheese, and sauteed onions and mushrooms. I added tomatoes, pico and jalapenos from the condiment bar. (see pic) They also had onions, peppercinis, lettuce, mustard, mayo and ketchup available. Everything was delicious! Tilapia was flakey and moist! Burger was good. Only criticism was the amount of oil used to sautee fish and veggies. By the time I was about finished, the last of the lettuce was swimming in oil.\n\nSo back to the homeless men on the patio. This is a problem that needs to be addressed. It was quite apparent they were there and had been before. At one point, one of them came in with a to go cup from somewhere, looked around and headed over to the drink station. I didn't talk to anyone about it that day, but will call to let them know.\n\nOverall, four stars. Will update after I call about the situation.

You definitely get what you pay for and then some.This d\u00e9cor of this buffet even looks fancy.\n\nYou get an assortment of good tasty food including cold and steamed crab legs, oysters, chicken and waffles, dim summ a taco station, shrimp and much much more.

My girls and I made this our last stop before heading back home to Cali. \n\nWe ordered salmon belly, yellowtail belly, baked mussels, and various rolls that I can't even remember all their names. We even ordered a baked chicken roll, which was not typical, but was unexpectedly tasty! The salmon, yellowtail and baked mussels were my favorites though. The fish was very fresh. Sometimes it's best to keep it simple, especially when you're eating so much!\n\nWe thought we would not have much room for dessert, so we decided to share a scoop of strawberry mochi ice cream, lychee sorbet and green tea ice cream. The lychee sorbet was really good, with real chunks of lychee on the inside, but the real winner was the strawberry mochi ice cream. We loved it so much we ordered two more scoops. \n\nService was good, though there was a little misunderstanding with quantity (make sure you know how much is in an order) and you can't beat the lunch price of $22 per person. \n\nMy only wish is that they would serve uni for lunch, but will definitely be back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "yD1dRYi7USzhYVKiqZ7JVg"}

I do have to credit enjoying this event  to not having to wait in long lines since I went the last day on Sunday at 7pm especially since I CAN NOT stand waiting too long when I'm hungry. I will end up eating someone's head off  haha.\nLet's start with my two favorite items:\nI had to get my Bacon Fuku Burger first, I always have to get something from them anytime they're at an event. Always delicious and not too bad for $6. I only wish their music wasn't sooo loud, the nice girl taking my order could barely hear me and you can barely hear when they call your name that your order is ready.\nI then tried this amazing BLT Lobster Roll, I can't exactly remember the food truck name but it was delicious. I mean for $16, it better be. The roll was toasted and buttery and extremely flavorful and the lobster was in nice chunky pieces, very sweet and light and all the other characteristics of what I want when I eat lobster.\nI then had some fried Risotto balls which were good but not exactly memorable, a Hawaiian inspired short rib taco with kimchee which was super flavorful and tender, and a fried milky way, oh my poor diet, it was way better than I thought it would be. \nOverall, I am definitely going next time they host Foodie Fest again and will definitely reccommend to go the last day at night so that the lines aren't long :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "VW8ljqxXd1CZ5pdSxQzmsQ"}

I once ordered a quesadilla that literally cracked and fell apart in my hands, and apparently the kitchen had mixed up their raw chicken with a rubber one. The burgers taste like they were scraped off of the bottom of a boat.\n\nAnd that's on a slow night.

And the thing about Brats is that literally half of the people here on a given night are the adult, alumni versions of the D-average alcoholics that make up the other half. \n\nThe trucker that wouldn't leave me alone truly deserves to be State Street Brats' mascot.

He said NO. whatever is on the buffet line display. I told him thought you guys can customize stuff if you have the ingredients. He just said NO again and went back making whatever he was making. Annoyed & upset again.\n\nWhile waiting on line saw these dessert on the screen display and when I got to the dessert area most the stuff on the screen display outside was not there.

Also they say there is over 500+ items there was not that many unless your counting all the damn hot sauces & toppings. sigh.\n\nAlso they ran out of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, waited a very long time, walked in circles too see when there going to get more & finally saw they had a cart there just sitting there. I told the dessert chef that it's behind her & can she just make it now cuz I only wanted one. I was waiting for about 10 mins for it. She said NO it not there yet, they're bring up from the restaurant. I pointed to the cart & she said it's the other side's cart & not her area. BULL Sh%t.

It took us about 15 mins to find her & asked to refill our drinks. But she apologized because 1 of the kitchen was a hot mess & she needed to go to a much further one. When our regular waiter came back our glasses was always full. Then bus boys came out & started to get the dishes off our table.\n\nThe Food Overall was OK nothing that I will remember & crave for it.

Clybourne's = glorified undergrad house party.  Seriously, it was like college parties all over again: Shoving through a packed dance floor/avoiding being stepped on by the people shoving through the packed dance floor, dancing awkwardly with one eye on the couple grinding behind you to avoid being hit by their wild gyrations, and weak drinks that you chug in the hopes that it'll somehow make the whole experience  fun.  I wanted to try out the only other place in the area with a decent dance floor (the other is Soma), but since this place is on campus, I should've known it'd be like, well, a glorified undergrad house party.  Which is totally fine, if that's what you're in the mood for (I unfortunately graduated two years ago and so have already had my fill of college parties).  Oh, except this party also charges $5 cover.\nAnyway, music isn't bad, and there's a pretty cool multi-floor layout with plenty of bars.  The drinks though are absolutely pathetic (aka standard for on-campus bars): I was voted \"one shot wonder\" of my sorority, and the drinks here got me at best mildly happy, and at worst wondering why I paid so much for just juice/soda/insert-mixer-of-your-choice.\nSo after a night of downing weak drinks, dancing awkwardly, and getting my ass grabbed, I think it's safe to say I'll be sticking with Soma.  At least there the drinks are real, I'll be tipsy enough to enjoy dancing on a packed dance floor, and if I must get my ass grabbed, at least most of the time it won't be by guys who're younger than me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pA-TU5anRV7T9abf0oTgtA"}

Five bucks bought me a fabulous falafel sandwich-tender falafel and plenty of veggies and hummus to moisten the pita-plus delicious fries and a Pepsi. For five bucks! At that price I could afford to order a fresh and tangy tahini salad on the side. The server was really nice and the food didn't take too long to arrive. I enjoyed the soothing ambience, the roomy and private booth, and the soft Middle Eastern music in the background. Their bathroom could use a little sprucing up, but that's my only complaint.

I began going to the original Aspinwall location about 3 years ago and have been in love with the food and \nthe brand ever since. \n\nFirst of all the restaurant itself is a great atmosphere. The whole heaven/hell thing is very creative. I'm always entertained by the wall art. \n\nThe food is really incredible. They have about 8 or 10 signature burgers that are always on the menu as well as a Burger special that changes daily (if you want to find out what it is today just follow them on twitter). They also have an option to build your own burger. What I love about this is that Burgatory has a lot of unique toppings you won't find a lot of other places. But when I get a burger here a usually end up getting the Farmer Brown. I know they have so many unique and delicious options but there's just something about this classic burger with a gourmet twist I love so much! The only negative burger feedback I have is that I got a bison burger once and it was pretty dry. I imagine it's just a dryer meat, but I didn't like it so I wouldn't recommend that.\n\nEven though you're probably going to Burgatory for burgers, they also have a lot of other great food as well. The pork belly sliders are incredible. I also really enjoy the fried mushroom appetizer. \n\nUnfortunately I can't really comment too much on the milkshakes. I had one a few years ago and from what I remember it was great, but every time I come here I come for the food. I can't fill up on a milkshake!\n\nIf you live in Pittsburgh and haven't gone to Burgatory yet, you need to go. Don't let the long wait reviews scare you. Yes you could be \"waiting\" for up to an hour or 90 minutes. But because Burgatory uses NoWait, they'll take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. That way you can walk around all the great shops at the waterfront. Charming Charlie is right next door! I could spend an hour in there alone!

I had a duck dish with honey glazed vegetables and it was delicious! Very unusual in its taste but I liked that it wasn't generic Thai food.

One of my bridesmaids actually had walk away because she could not take how the manager was talking down to and treating me. On top of that when I went for my trial I was told that eyelashes are included ($15 value, but they are ardelle brand that you can get at walgreens for $5) but I could upgrade to the Mink Winks and just pay the difference. Well when on the day of my wedding I upgraded they charged by the full amount $35 and when I asked the manager about this charge she told me that, that is not how it is done and that there is nothing that can be done about it, really?

Based on my experience (& others I've referred) no other florist in the valley even COMES CLOSE. \nSince I'm a native, VERY selective & a big-time researcher (aka. \"tough customer\" or \"frugal\" as described by less tactful friends) I'm one of those people others come to when in need of a referral.  God's Garden is the ONLY place I recommend, not once have I referred to someone who was less than thrilled with what they got. No business can please 100% of its customers 100% if the time, since much is left to \"customer interpretation\" and impossible to control every logistic, supplier, employee etc. But this place comes scary-close! They've accommodated seemingly impossible timelines with dead-on accuracy (no pun intended, but funeral included) with almost no lead time, and EVERY SINGLE TIME my arrangement was all the talk.\nMy guess is that they purchase from different suppliers than the other guys, they always have exotic flowers/fillers on-hand, even for same, day orders, most of which I've never seen before (and I and THRIVE on \"unique\" when it comes to flowers) which I swear makes it more exciting for ME than the receiver seeing them for the first time!  Always a surprise, ALWAYS the arrangement everyone's \"oohing & aahing\" over.  \nWhat I love the most - I can just tell Karin what I'm trying to accomplish with my arrangement, a feeling, a look I want, colors, specific types of flowers I do/don't want, how much I have to spend etc. & she does the rest. I've NEVER been able to do this before without getting a lame, run of the mill, overpriced arrangement. Even if I have little to spend, she's so creative she can throw together a few pieces and still make them REALLY stand out. \nThe owner seems like a big-time perfectionist, I'm sure her staff is as gifted as she when it comes to \"interpreting customers wishes\" but can't say since Im too chicken so I prefer to place orders direct w/ her. \nAnother note worth mentioning... the many times these guys have saved my a** (and also a**es of my friends who called me in a panic after rejected by other florists, unable/unwilling to accommodate timelines) & not only did they say, \"YES\" but came through with flying colors. this is why I'm talking the time to write this long-winded review (which I rarely do, being the hard-to-please customer I am & admittedly selfish with what little time I have) - because I believe this is a secret worth sharing, and only appropriate to promote a business as excellent as this one. Based on the numerous hat/rabbit tricks I've seen her pull off successfully, I'm confident Karin will figure out a way to maintain the quality, genius creativity & excellent service as they grow. If I had more than two thumbs, they would ALL BE UP for God's Garden. \nThanks guys/girls for ALWAYS making me look and for NEVER dropping the ball, even in a pinch. More than happy to return the favor by sharing my experiences with others who have need for your services but (like me) no tolerance for mediocrity.  PLEASE ... keep up the great work!", "type": "review", "business_id": "f3FIWAkSz8P6hOwWOsYJdQ"}

The manager replied that they could not touch the pizza once it came out and that the answer was \"no.\" So it's okay to touch it before it goes into the oven, but after that, no. Got it. \n\nShe then said \"my manager said I could give you bread stick bags.\" I said \"you don't have a small box?\" and she replied that the request was impossible. So she gives me these paper bags. I open the pizza box at the counter to start to separate the slices into these narrow bags for my kid, which is clearly not working. The pizza is piping hot, burning my hands, cheese is going everywhere and it's not even sliced right, so I'm having to pull the scalding pizza slice off with my fingers and then place it in a skinny paper bag. \n\nThe manager sees my frustration and says \"is everything okay.\" and I say, \"Can I just have a small box to put these slices in? This really isn't working.\" He replies that they don't have a small box. \n\n\"Anything? Something you put breadsticks in or something?\" \n\n\"No.\"\n\nI then spot a small box out of the corner of my eye that has cinnamon shit in it or something. \n\n\"I just saw a small box.

The server was able to answer all of our questions and the sommelier came by when we had questions about wine.\n\nThe bread they served at the start was hot, fresh, buttery, and sweet. It reminded me of Kings Hawaiian sweet rolls. It didn't need butter, but if you wanted to slather some on for good measure, it was there. We ordered a bottle of red wine and settled in for the meal. I don't remember which red wine we got, but it was very smooth and went well with our meal.\n\nWe started with the warm frisee salad with bacon and egg. It is one of the most decadent salads I've eaten. The warm egg coated everything in a creamy blanket as you mixed up the salad and the savory crispy bacon punched through as you ate everything together. If salads were always like this, I would eat it every day.\n\nFor the main course, I got the 12 oz. domestic wagyu skirt steak, medium. Two of my friends shared the 32 oz. dry aged porterhouse, and my other friend got the surf and turf. We also ordered sides of spinach and yukon gold puree. Usually at steakhouses, the meat comes out piping hot because the plate is hot like a space shuttle on reentry. Maybe they just don't do that here, or maybe our food was waiting a while for pickup, but my steak was just lukewarm when it arrived. I was a little disappointed. That said, the skirt steak had great flavor, had perfect tenderness, and I ate the whole thing.\n\nI could see my friends that ordered the porterhouse were struggling, and I saw why. It was so massive. I tried a piece, and it had a quick hit of great flavor, but the sheer size of my piece had me munching on it past its flavor burst, like a piece of gum.\n\nThe sides of spinach and yukon gold puree were tasty too, but also, for some reason, were not very hot when they came out.\n\nWe didn't get dessert because we were so full, and we didn't want to feel like beached whales.\n\nOverall, it was an awesome time with great friends and great food. My only gripe was the temperature of the food when it came out. It might seem like a nitpick, but having your food nice and hot when it arrives makes a big difference.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HbUQ_3dlm3uCacmhTEMnuA"}

Lately I have not been able to find anything everything has been super overpriced, or just not what I liked. This last time that I went into the store, the cashiers  looked at me like I was trying to steal something. Now I understand I do have a lot of tattoos, and there is a stigma with them, but I definitely am not a shoplifter. It seems like they were following me around, and I felt really uncomfortable. I was really disheartened that they did not greet me as I walked in, but every other person that walked in they were very nice to them and said welcome to Kohl's how can I help you? \n\nI ventured into the shoe area, where was looking for two specific shoes. A ballet flat, or a nice gym shoes. I went around and of course I couldn't find anything there , I finally did find a shoe and I wanted a size that I was not able  to find. I went around looking  for the cashier or the worker and of course nobody was around.\n\nThe 1 thing that I do not like in  the shoe area, is that some of the shoes are priced differently they say 20 dollars on the box but you ring them up and end up being 30 dollars.

A lot of slight of hand sells you on doing things that, anywhere other than Las Vegas, you might balk at.  The Wynn is the Lance Burton of hotels. Slick, smooth, and opulent, from the multi-million dollar waterfalls to the championship golf course right behind the hotel, to the spacious rooms with flat screen tvs, it would appear that no expense has been spared to make your visit a memorable one. \n\nThe reality is a little less obvious than the smoke and mirrors that dazle you here, and I can see why Wynn hasn't dominated the Bellagio, THEHotel or Four Seasons, which, if you're reading this, you may also be considering.\n\nI should add that I don't gamble, so how good or bad the casino is will have to be left to those with that bent. I also don't smoke, and I'm a lightweight drinker, which just puts me in a category of non-addictive personality that Vegas just hates.\n\nIf you don't have deep pockets, forget about the casino tables or the slots... The food and services here are all obscenely expensive. Double just about every bill that you're used to getting most other places. Admittedly, some of the restaurants feature the best chefs in the world, so the $145/per person to eat at Alex may be worth it, but the steakhouse is not all that great and you can find a better meal at other major eateries for about 1/3 to 1/2 less.\n\nThe golf course is beautiful, but at $500.00 a round, it's pretty empty. I hear that high rollers get to use it for free.\n\nFor a hotel that spent millions on one fountain display, and has spent millions more on the entry ways, carpets, etc. the ventilation system is its achilles heel. I'm on a smoke free floor but the air is carried up from the casino floor and the hallways reek of smoke. Point to Bellagio which manages that much better. Smoking is \"allowed\" in the casino but in practical fact it's allowed everywhere but the restaurants because no one is going to stop you.  If you're not used to smoky environments, you will feel it quickly.  If I wanted that, I would go to the Venetian and die from the pollution, and we're not talking the canals.\n\nThe view from our side of the hotel, where they have King/Queen combos (read families), faces the golf course, which is cool, and the construction of the new tower here at the Wynn which is not... Did they mention that I might be awakened at 5:30am by the construction when we booked? Noooo... \n\nOkay, so that won't happen to most of you because you're booking after 2008's early part of the year. Or will it? The Frontier next door went down and a multi-billion (Yes B billion) development is going up there. READ MORE NOISE.  To be fair, Bellagio is sitting next to a massive construction project at the moment too, but most of their rooms are not exposed to it.\n\nIt is a nice hotel, with fabulous fixtures. I think I would stay at Bellagio or THEHotel next time.  Even though I can easily afford it, I take offense to $7.00 bags of potato chips and feeling nickled-and-dimed on everything.\n\nThen again, this place works on PT Barnum theory, so I'm sure that the next sucker that comes along will pay it with a big smile and point to the nice trees in the entry and the lovely marble and the designer shopping and enjoy the slight of hand.\n\nWith all of the new hotels springing up that are one-uping each other, Wynn should focus on things that induce more customer loyalty and less shopping the latest and greatest.", "type": "review", "business_id": "u9wjRhUjySkHPa_hG3kFOg"}

I can't wait to try the other unique options.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jpQoe7-1JgXMLojwIp1kDg"}

Was always previously concerned about being in Vegas for a long period of time as the whole scene just gets very old.  MGM Signature is wonderfully tucked away and I could have stayed there for weeks.  The hotel consists of three separate towers behind MGM with a separate gated entrance.  No long valet lines or herds of people. \n\nWhat I loved about the room ...\n\n- Pullout bed\n- DVD player\n- Kitchen with mini refrigerator/freezer, coffee maker, toaster, two burner stove, blender, microwave, pots/pans, cutlery, plates, etc.\n- Wonderful jacuzzi tub\n\nMy son and I ate breakfast and lunch everyday in our room.  I was making pancakes, scrambled eggs and smoothies in the tiny kitchen.  We brought in all of our groceries and it was so convenient to be able to make our own meals and not rely upon hotel dining.\n\nWe stayed in tower one but the pool at that tower did not permit children.  Short walk to tower two pool, which was great.  My son really had a blast.  We did spend a day at the MGM pool - which was madness - but enjoyed the lazy river.  It was really nice to be at a quiet pool away from the party scene.  We were able to walk everywhere from the hotel.  100 degrees outside but we walked indoors from the Signature to MGM to NY NY to Excalibur.  \n\nThis hotel is very right for people who are looking for what I was looking for!  If you want to be in the hustle and bustle with a casino in the hotel, etc., I would stay elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KpZLxHrp2PIP8tLBsPLiww"}

We headed up there for some takeout on Friday night with a hankering for the BBQ.  \n\nAfter finding the strip mall that it is in (note to those unfamiliar with the location, it's in the same strip mall as Pappy's, which has more conspicuous signage), we went inside, which was empty.  I counted a total of six chairs at two tables (not including the two chairs in the waiting area) so if you are planning to eat there, hopefully it is during a lull.  \n\nGrady greeting us promptly and gave us a tour of the menu.  We put our meat orders in, and Grady when to the back to get it going.  While he did this, his wife (I assume) helped us as we chose our sides.  The brisket dinner I ordered came with one hot side and one cold side, but I wondered if I could get double hot (mac n' cheese) instead.  She told me no, which was kind of disappointing because the menu said something about accepting all reasonable requests.  I was later super surprised and happy when my brisket came out with double mac AND the cold side, potato salad, I had ordered.  Now that's some nice service!  \n\nOn to the food, it smelled and looked great.  I had the brisket (mild sauce), *double* mac n cheese and potato salad.  The wife had a pork sandwich and cole slaw.  She liked her food and commented that she would eat there again.  My food was good, the first couple bites of brisket seemed a little chewy, but after that all was good.  I liked the flavor of the potato salad as well, though my wife thought that it was store-made.  The leftovers were also good the day after as well.\n\nThe ranking above says 4 stars, but it is really 4.5 stars.  The service was super friendly and food was very good.  I will definitely be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Pju_pKfvEnUYV9wMVNsacg"}

When a Groupon came out (2 brunches for $98), I snapped it up! \n\nI made my 12p reservation about a month in advance, then reconfirmed it the morning of brunch (Sunday, 12/23).  When I called, the representative had some difficulty finding it, but eventually did, saying that it was made on the \"old system.\"\n\nWhen we arrived at 11:46am,  it was a madhouse- people everywhere!  We waited in line for the hostess to check in. She seemed flustered and had a thick accent.  She too, seemed to have some difficulty finding the reservation, but said that she had it and that it would be about a 25-30 min wait.  Given the number of people milling about, I wasn't surprised, but a tiny bit annoyed (what's the point of making a reservation, then?). Moreover, the system they used was archaic. They wrote down your name onto a slip of paper, and tried to keep the slips in some semblance of order, but still separating who was using a Groupon from those who were paying full price, so Groupon holders were seated after full-price patrons.  There was a walk-up bar where you could get a free (included) bloody mary, but I didn't want to spoil my appetite. \n\nAfter about 40 min, I went to check on our seating status. I noticed our slip on the hostess stand, and she said that there were 3 people ahead of us- noting that the people whose slips were sitting on the stand were next.  I said okay. 4 other parties were seated, and I went back to the stand, noticing that our slip was no longer there. I asked what had happened to it, and she said that the seater must have taken it. I waited, and the seater returned, with no slips in hand. I asked again, what was going on, because our slip that was on the stand and due to be next, was no longer there. The hostess found it- now in the MIDDLE of the pile of slips in her hand- no longer on the stand. I angrily asked what had happened, because 10 min ago, it was on the stand. She initially argued, but saw that I was angry and not to be deterred, so told the seater to go ahead and give us a table. \n\nAfter that, I was a bit upset and flustered, but determined not to let it ruin my meal.  The waiter was very charming and never let our Champagne glass get lower than 1/2 full. Fresh squeezed OJ was also served, but in those tiny juice glasses, so we had to ask for refills fairly often. I also got a Sprite.\n\nNow, off to the food.  I sampled almost everything: 3 lobster tails, 2 lamb chops, the salmon/shrimp/crab pastry, red snapper, fillet mignon, made to order lobster omelette,  bacon, mini-quiche, mini-Belgium waffle. My husband also sampled the turkey, potatoes, and prime rib.  I found everything to be pretty tasty, although the lobster could have used some seasoning. I was too full to attempt the steamed shrimp, raw oysters, or caviar. I most enjoyed the omelette and the waffle, and of course the lobster.\n\nFor dessert, I had a made to order crepe with bananas, grand marnier, and whipped cream. That was simply delicious!  \n\nAll in all, it was a good experience (minus the debacle at the front of the house), so I have no major complaints, but it wasn't all that I'd expected. The selection is definitely better at the Wynn, the M, or Wicked Spoon (for half the cost), and if you are looking for the ambiance PLUS the delicious food experience (at a slightly lower price point, Groupon notwithstanding), I'd suggest the Jazz Brunch at the Country Club at Wynn.  I'm glad I visited the Sterling Brunch, but I won't be a repeat customer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dl5K9Hc2kUcGcrVIQAOhWQ"}

REALLY GOOD.  There is nothing that I have ordered there that I have not liked.  It is also convenient for us as it's about 2 miles from our home.\n\nHOWEVER, the service is NEVER GOOD.  I have eaten there with my husband 3 times.  The 1st time, we ate there kind of late.  We were among 3 or 4 tables of people left in the place.  The waitress seemed tired and didn't really seem to care that we were there.  She was far from friendly and the service was far from marvelous.  It took longer than I feel it should to get our food.\n\nThe second time we ate there, we sat in the bar area.  The bartender/server was eventually friendly this time, but only by the point we were about to leave.  In the beginning she didn't seem to care much and was just kind of blah.  I think maybe she warmed up because they got my order wrong.  I don't like refried beans so I asked if I could have a double rice portion instead of rice and beans.  When I ordered, the server said that was fine, but my plate came with beans and rice anyway.  She did offer to take the whole thing back and fix it, but I was so hungry, I just kept the plate.  Again, it takes quite a while to get your food whether they are busy or not.\n\nThe 3rd time we were there was last night (my husband, our baby, and a friend of mine).  They messed up my order AGAIN.  This time I had asked for tamales with no cheese over the top of them.  It came with cheese on the top.   This time, I was so frustrated, I didn't even bother to bring it up to the server and she didn't even notice it was wrong.  If she would have, with her attitude I doubt she would have genuinely cared anyway.  Again, it takes so long to get your food out at this restaurant when it's slow that I just sucked it up and ate it anyway as this was a Friday night and BUSY.  The server again was blah.  Not bad, but not friendly.\n\nIn conclusion, this restaurant could greatly improve its Yelp reviews if they would make an effort to make people feel appreciated and welcome.  The staff needs a lesson in customer service and they need to get a good flow of positive energy going.  \n\nTHEY ALSO NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT GETTING THEIR ORDERS CORRECT!!!  LIKE I SAID, I HAVE EATEN THERE 3 TIMES AND MY ORDER WAS WRONG TWICE.  To me, that is not acceptable.  I sincerely hope someone from management there reads this so that they can fix it because the atmosphere there as well as the food is good.  That's why I gave them 3 chances despite my past experiences.  Sorry, guys - 3 strikes - YOU'RE OUT!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "jVgtPnzXvZQOCCIUPEBktA"}

I hate to think the outcome if she had serious issues.\n\nMy daughter has eczema. The cure? Buy more OTC cream! That's it. Not a review of allergens, no plan for treatment when creams weren't helping, no talk of a referral to a dermatologist. When cetaphil cream wasn't helping her raw, oozing skin we were told to try very expensive formula despite her having zero signs of food allergies other than this. I decided to take her to a Phoenix Children's Derm who was confused over their inability to treat a very common skin issue. The prescription creams should have been prescribed no problem and apparently the diet they had us put her on was pointless in our circumstances.\n\nSo we get another ped. We go to this appointment only to find out they MISSED GIVING HER VACCINATIONS. When the new office called GD, they informed that we did not take her to doc apnts. EXCUSE ME?! We have taken her to every doctors appointment recommended, have consented to all vaccines and followed through with ever (stupid) recommendation they made. \n\nWe were also lectured at every visit about how much we fed our baby. As in we fed her too much. My child is in the lower % for weight.  She grows fine and eats within the recommended amounts. I don't know why this was the focus of her apnts.\n\nThere are SO many other options for doctors out there. Our new doc is absolutely fantastic.

The girl in at the time (I don't know if this was Lily) admitted she was really hungover after lots of prosecco, red wine and rum the night before (ouch). I liked this very human element of her and her florists shop. Not all ribbons and pretence and pomp.\n\nSo when I selected the flowers I wanted individually, and we chatted, I watched her put the bouquet together. I admit, at first I was worried it may not turn out the best, given her very hungover state, and slightly sombre look (we all know that feeling). But as we chatted she slowly but surely put together the random array of flowers I had chosen into a beautiful bouquet, and I was quite delighted with the final result. Even from the dark green, tropical looking leaves she choose to frame the flowers, and the nifty way she wrapped it all in paper and cellophane.\n\nI think Kelly was equally delighted with the flowers. So really, that's all that matters.\n\nI wouldn't send people out of their way to Lily West, but I do really like what she is doing. With a nice selection of fresh flowers, and obviously a talent for arranging even in a fragile state, it's a great independent florist in a rather innocuous spot", "type": "review", "business_id": "XYQufUu17LkxvZslsp0fbg"}

It's a great that  only 7 of us were present- we were packed in the booth like sardines. Regarding the food- it was everything the reviews mentioned. I had the guacamole stack- try it if you are a fan of avocado, the flatbread- my favorite, and the truffle fries, my second favorite. I also tried the Korean wings- too spicy for my taste, fried meatballs- just ok, nothing special, lemon chicken skewer-they were ok, I would not order them again, and a host of other items. The last thing I tried was the pistachio ice cream. It was no bueno!!! It was completely tasteless. The server was nice enough to remove it from my tab.

I made a reservation on OpenTable and in the comments I requested seating in the Swan Court.  When I arrived, there was a large group near that area.  I was seated in the main dining room with a wonderful view of the wine tower.\n\nShortly after being seated, the assistant general manager came over and apologized for the inability to seat me in the Swan Court as they were having several groups that evening.  I asked him about getting some photos of the outside, and he took me then while there was still some good daylight.  He unlocked the door and we went to the patio and I got some shots.  On the way back to the table, he gave me his business card for future reservations or help, and he had a liter bottle of S. Pellegrino brought to my table.  \n\nOn to the food.  I got the Parallel Tasting menu.  I'm going to use the descriptions from the menu because I could not have typed them all into my iPhone without being there for hours.\n\nCourse One was called the tomato course.  One plate had Textures of Tomato, light seared langoustine, and Ajo Blanco.  The parallel plate had Tesroa Tomato Confit, basil pearls, and aged balsamic brittle.\n\nCourse Two was the corn course.  One plate had summer corn Agnolotti, velout\u00e9, orels and fava beans, and popcorn shoots.  The parallel plate had Ruby Red Corn culantro, a Diver scallop, and Guanciale. \n\nCourse Three was the veal course.  One plate had veal tenderloin, Australian winter truffles, porcini lasagna, and truffle vinaigrette. The parallel plate had veal sweet breads, curried cauliflower and champagne grape slices, and Budha hand citrus.\n\nCourse Four was the coconut course.  One plate had coconut scented cheesecake, Malibu rum caramel, and Lychee sorbet.  The parallel plate had coconut rice pudding, mango sorbet, and fennel crisp.  With the coconut course, I was brought a small plate with four petit fours or mignardises.  When I polished all of that off, my server brought me 3 hand made chocolate truffles.  \n\nThe food was great!  I really enjoyed the idea of the parallel plates with two takes on a given food.  Corn two ways, coconut a couple of ways, tomato, and of course the wonderful veal.\n\nService was exemplary.  My server, Russell, was always nearby for anything I needed without hovering.  We found out that we live not too far from each other and I showed him on Yelp the new location he can buy Bon Breads in our neighborhood.  Yea, Yelp!  The numerous bus people were all quite efficient at clearing dishes, refilling my water glass, or whatever was needed.  The staff passed my twisted artificial sweetener pack test with flying colors.  It was removed in about 8 seconds.\n\nI really like the layout of the restaurant and if I couldn't sit in the Swan Court, I was glad to be where I was.  I am fascinated by that wine tower and I watched one of the wine angels ascend several times to get wine for a table.  This was a memorable dining experience and I will be back.  Hold the swans--I'll be there.\n\nEdit:  I have to add that the staff let me \"play\" with one of their iPads from which you can order wines or cocktails.  I sent myself an email from the iPad describing the cocktail I didn't have but I just tried it out.  It's a neat way of remembering the wine you had without having to use your memory if you email yourself.  Too bad it's a dedicated iPad.

I asked people where this place is at since all I know is that it's close to Olympic Garden. I used my GPS to help me find this place and brought me to Art of Flavors. Where is this place? Ah, it's right next door to Art of Flavors tucked in the corner.\n\nAfter a yummy experience from an arepas foodtruck, we got garlic shrimp arepa, pork butt arepa with cheese, Reina Pepiada arepa, wood fire chicken arepa and fried plantains. They have more options here compared to the foodtruck which is not surprising. The prices are about the same. But the arepa itself is less toasted and is heavier than the foodtruck version. The cilantro sauce is equally as good, this place's spicy/red sauce is spicier. I had to try their guanabana juice to compare it to what I had when I was a kid. \n\nGarlic Shrimp Arepa:\nNo tomatoes or veggies, just straight up garlic shrimp. I liked this a lot especially with the cilantro sauce which elevates the garlic flavor of the shrimp.  5/5\n\nRoasted Pork Butt:\nComes with tomato slices. Add cheese. In case you didn't know, pork butt = pork shoulder and not the actual butt of a pig. Tasty pork. Both the spicy and cilantro sauce work well with this. 4/5\n\nReina Pepiada Arepa:\nCold chicken with mayo, avocado and cilantro. Tastes just like the one from the arepas foodtruck. A much better version of a chicken salad. 5/5\n\nWood Fire Chicken Arepa:\nReally flavorful chicken with tomato, onions and lettuce. 4/5\n\nFried Plantains:\nI love this stuff. My mom would fry some plantains for me as a snack when I was a kid. So simple and easy to make yet it tastes so good. The natural sweetness of the plantains come out when you fry them in high temperatures. Eventhough they could have gotten rid of the excess oil, I still like these things. 5/5\n\nGuanabana:\nAKA soursop juice and in Filipino, guyabano. This tastes like concentrate mixed with lots of sugar and water. I couldn't taste soursop. 3/5\n\nAfter that meal, we headed next door for dessert. After dessert, I decided to come back here so I can try the chicharron with fried yucca. Shawn tapped out as I was enjoying chicharron and yucca. All he said to me was \"I can't believe how you're still eating.\"\n\nChicharron with Fried Yucca:\nThe chicharron wasn't the same crispy fatty pork I was excpeting. The yucca was good with the cilantro sauce though. It was as if I was eating garlic fries. Yum! 4/5", "type": "review", "business_id": "blgSBn3CimrCHn2SuZvcZw"}

There are enough meat on each dumpling that made this good appetizer considering it's a little pricey for me. The sauce for the dumpling is quite good as well with a hint of ginger and sweetness to it.\n\n2) Thai Tea = Hubby ordered it and he likes it. It was kinda weird that they give you syrup on the side as their thai tea doesn't come sweet to begin with. It was creamy and the tea flavor is not overwhelming. \n\n3) Panang Tofu (Spiceness #1) = This was very good. It was creamy and the flavor was perfect. The tofu came out perfectly fried yet not hard...it was just right. This is definitely comparable to Archi's panang.\n\n4) Panang Beef (Medium Spiceness) = My brother-in-law ordered this and he was quite happy.  He did say that their medium is more spicy that what he normally gets but he loves it nonetheless. \n\n5) Beef Pad See Ew (Spiceness #1) = I was disappointed on this one unfortunately.  I really want to like it but it was bland and dry. It definitely could more sweet soy sauce. I just wouldn't get this in future. \n\n6) Beef Fried Rice (Spiceness #1) = Hubby ordered this and he loves it. He would like to be a little bit more spicy but that did not disappoint him. He loves the flavor of it so he's a happy camper.\n\nOverall, the food is good. They are pricey considering the portions are fairly small.  The service was good but there were only 3 table (including us). One thing we notice though, the table setting was incomplete. We already had our food and we only had napkins and knife on the table.  The server and busboy doesn't seem to communicate well as we haven't even gotten all our food and the busboy is already taking our plates to start clean up which I find odd. I also have to agree with the other review, it is freezing cold in there. The A/C was on full blast which was unnecessary at night I think but it was too cold to be comfortable.  The communication between staff and the cold A/C is where the 1 star deduction came from. We would definitely be back to try the other foods in the menu.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PrYKua8LhcYYjMmmIPPkhA"}

The irony, of course, is that Arizonans consider this to be perfectly passable Mexican food, but a far cry from palate-pleasing perfection. I suppose I find myself bitter knowing that such deliciousness could be viewed with such a blas\u00e9 indifference by Phoenix's elite critics; in New York, we still seek out the one true answer to the Mexican food problem, yet in Phoenix, the answer is so abundant it produces disenchantment.\n\nWell, friends, we'd gladly take your La Fonda Del Sol. You get to keep the rest of those Mexican restaurants you love, so it's only a minor loss. In exchange, you may have a Rosa Mexicana and a Dos Caminos. Nay, don't thank me.\n\nSo, La Fonda.... Truly spicy, homemade salsa; perfectly crisp chile rellenos bathed in cheese, crusty chimichangas battered in love and ambrosia, husk-wrapped tamales that taste homemade; huge portions, incredibly low prices. This is what it's all about.\n\nYeah, the tacky pastel Mexican decorations are unnerving and the service is slow and often panicked, but these are minor gripes.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, these idiots forklift themselves into the waiting lines of NYPD Pizza (HA! HAHAHA!) and Oregano's (BAHH! HAHA!) while overlooking the real gem that sits in between them. Well, if you're a New Yorker like me, you're not gonna try either of those wrecks anyhow; go get some Mexican.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Vx7-xbazum3dgo3Qj3i4pQ"}

Had I written about this place last October when I first went, I would have given this place 4 stars.  But it seems like their standards dropped.  It could have been because we were there before the rush, but there were lots of food items that sat stale under heat lamps.  \n\nThe \"angry\" mac n cheese tasted like part of the cheese came from powder.  In fact, some of the items downright tasted like school cafeteria food, just presented nicely in little plates.  I appreciate nice presentation, but it doesn't compensate for lack of quality.  Bone marrow tasted disgusting (like a blob of fat).  I guess that appeals to some.  The figs and the banh mi sandwich were great though they were one of the very few things that were memorable.  A lot of the desserts were cute, but tasted like crap, except for some yellow cream dome cake looking thing.  Gellato was good, but really hard to mess up that one.\n\nIf you haven't been before, I say it's worth checking out once if you're in Vegas since this is the buffet that started the latest trend in serving food in little dishes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

In fact, it's still that same old diner adjacent to Rum Runner that serves one of the best burgers in Las Vegas.  So why must I write an update and even take down a star from my initial review?!  I suppose my last experience was rather appalling.  \n\nAfter going to the bar numerous times for years, it was a first that a menu was brought to my attention.  Having always ordered the burger with desired fixins and a side of hot wings, I wanted to venture out and go for something else.  After reading through an extensive array of items I didn't know the restaurant has offered in the past, I decided to go for the roast beef.  For $7.99, the meal comes with salad or soup, vegetable of the day and a choice of potato.  To my surprise, the dish was not as I expected it to be.  The meat itself was comparable to prepackaged deli one can get at grocery stores.  Only if the menu mentioned that part, I could have saved money or ordered something else as I didn't even eat more than a bite from it.\n\nOverall, Badger Cafe is still my go-to late night burger joint.  Perhaps, don't expect highly of their other items on the menu if you do end up going that route.  One thing's certain, I'll just stick to what I know best and order that next time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yOLyhudDoL2faBOK0dAN3Q"}

The layout of the bar has changed so now there is loads of space, new seating areas and the toilets dont fill me with fear any more... they reminded of that shower room in Saw without the guy chained to a pipe obviously. :D\n\nDrink selection is pretty good and they now do cocktails. One aspect I liked about this place was the staff and a few familiar faces are still around. \n\nOne thing to look out for is the live music nights, these can be great fun and they still run them. look up the facebook page for pub quizes and live music nights.

For an App this small and bland it just isn't worth it to order at all.\nFor dinner My wife ordered her fav dish (Chicken Chittinadu) and she requested spicy, real spicy and I ordered mine the Murgh Tikka Masala. Once again the presentation was fancy but the meal was very light on spices. My dish was really more like a thick tomato soup with chicken than a spicy Tikka Masala like I am used to and Hers was barely negligible on the spicy level.\nLastly and the biggest thing I didn't like was adding in 30% gratuity automatically on a $37 bill the tip was auto billed in at $11. This was for a party of TWO people.\nOverall it is a nice Indian Restaurant if you have never had Indian Food before and want someplace nice to take a date.\nSave some cash and a go to Passage To India (University Area).

They have everything and it's a great place to wander around and kill time. The staff is pretty knowledgeable about their products and can answer most if not all of your questions.

What I mean by this is that often times the TV's they sell are specific to them. I've tried many times to check out reviews of their TV's through CNet or Consumer Reports and discover that they don't have that item reviewed because it is specific to Best Buy. They'll review the most similar item they can, but it's not the same. I find this very frustrating if I plan on spending money on a large ticket item. \n\nMy latest experience with this was on Black Friday weekend. They had a 50\" Plasma 1080 Panasonic on sale for $600, which is an amazing deal. I couldn't find any reviews of it on my phone so thought I do some research then come back. I came back with the intent to purchase it, but they informed me it was sold out across the country. I found this to be very annoying. If the item is advertised, and still being advertised in the store they should honor the price even if they have to order it. Their response to me was \"Sorry\" I get that stores sell out of things, but if they are advertising the item, still have it hanging in the store with the price they should stand by it, not tell me I'm S.O.L.\n\nOutside of this experience I've been very happy with things I've purchased from Best Buy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yN4yneHvWGq0uHJKHxhC3w"}

Their pricing is straightforward and very reasonable. \n\nWe scheduled the appointment for Friday afternoon from 3-5. Brandon emailed me around 2:00 and told me that they were running late because they had some complications with a previous client, and that they could still be there or I could reschedule. This was huge for me. I really appreciated that they didn't keep me waiting around all afternoon. We rescheduled for the following week, and I had my afternoon back.\n\nThe day of the appointment, the technician arrived on time. He was super clean, and very respectful of my floors, walls and furniture. He was very careful with his ladder, and when he made a mess (duct cleaning can be messy) he cleaned it all up. I'm a bit of a clean freak, and I had no issues dirt anywhere when they were done.\n\nThe whole appointment took about 2 hours, and I was very happy with the results.\n\nOne minor point that I want to mention. They spray a sanitizer in the vents, and they warn you that your house is going to smell like a dentist's office for about half an hour. The smell is pretty strong. It's not a bad smell, but it's kind of medicinal. I could still smell it an hour later.

Sometimes you are wondering if the bartenders think they are too cool to serve you.  It can be tough sometimes to find a seat but busy usually means good and fun.  Overall a pretty good beer/cocktail drinking bar in the growing down town area.  It is nice too that you can walk around and try a few other places without getting into your car here.  Just go across the street and you have plenty of options.  I would recommend the lounge like area in the back left with the soft chairs and more relaxed feel.

IHOP or Gallo Blanco?  IHOP or Gallo Blanco?  Hmmmm.  The price point is close.  \n\n\nI've been blessed to travel outside the borders of the mighty USA, visit other nations, immerse briefly in other languages and cultures and return home to my enviably comfortable life.  I've also been blessed to travel in the nations inside our nation, experiencing the richness and languages of the Indigenous people.  But those are other stories.  \n\nA Southwest January morning, seven to nine AM in a simple concrete-floored room,  north and east glass walls, the rising sun filling the room with light. Clean lined, simple, sturdy furnishings,  local art on the walls,  local agriculture cooked and served, friendly service with a lovely countenance.   This makes heavenly moments in my book of life.\n\nIf you've traveled some outside our nation's borders, at least the way I have, you'll find yourself in elemental cafes.  A cooking space, a counter, eating space.  Lots of windows, good ambient lighting.  Gallo Blanco(GB) poured me a cup full of memories.  \n\nI was looking for a place to sit, have a pastry and coffee, passing time until 9 am when my destination opened.  I ended up having a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice, and a plate of four freshly made crepes drizzled with honey and dolloped with whipped cream and apple compote.  Excellent.  \n\nDon't tell anyone, I brought my own cup of coffee into the Clarendon/GB.  I was treated to a refill.  The refill provided a thoughtful counterpoint about, \"What is good coffee anyway?\"   \n\nIf you're in the locale, I encourage you to give the GB a try.  There are several good spots for breakfast within two miles.  Put GB in your rotation.  In the open airiness of GB, with it's echo dampening acoustic tiles in strategic ceiling spots, and nearby lobby seating of the Clarendon, a group could schedule productive breakfast meetings.   And that's most of my bit on GB.  \n\nWhat is good coffee?   Edra devoted several years of her life to me.  A globe-trotting ace, she mastered the art of good accommodations at reasonable prices without a travel agent just as Bell Labs learned to spell UNIX and DARPA funded a project ultimately named \"Internet\" that has made travel arrangements easy.    \n\nI had my first real cup of coffee in Portugal.  A decent old downtown Lisbon hotel serving petite dejeuner in a courtyard framed by box hedge and roses, lit mostly by winter sunlight.  A smooth, flavorful, nutty, medium-heavy roast non-acid cup like nothing I'd known before.  With a little cream, the perfect match for the giant flaky croissants served with butter and apricot preserves.  Maybe the memory makes it better than it was.  It was definitely the best cup of coffee I'd ever tasted served in a city with coffee houses three centuries old.  \n\nOur nation has embraced coffee sophistication.  More an orgy than an embrace, it tastes to me that the only way to be cool in the American coffee world is carbonize the beans, use way too much brew product, and deliver a cup of charcoal juice, harsh, yet dehydrating to the mouth.\n\nI had a taster's moment at GB.  I brought in a pretty good cup of custom-roast coffee with a decent array of flavors, slightly throat-parching. I got to compare it with GB's house/breakfast blend.  GB's coffee was smoother, with more flavor.  For me, this is a good place for a morning cup.  \n\nThis concludes the GB moment.  \n\nAnd Edra, wherever you are, I hope you kept the bulimia under control.  You looked SO fine once you got that fifteen pounds back on your lithe frame and under your sagging skin.  Ummm, those sweet new curves.   So smart, so well-educated, well-traveled and hard-working.  How did the world ever create that self-image in you? \n\nNever mind.  I know how.\n\nThe Clarendon hasn't forgotten Don Bolles, fighter for honesty and justice.  Neither should we.

However, the menu doesn't stop there. Also available are soups, rice dishes, sushi and more. Lastly, Raku has offers kaiseki meals -- like a tasting menu, with a Japanese bent.\n\nRaku's specials deserve special mention. There are usually a dozen or so specials listed on a small chalk board. Your server should go over these with you. If not, be sure to ask, as these are some of the best things available. You could easily make a meal from the specials alone.\n\nItems arrive as they're ready. There may be a long wait for an item; on the other hand, several items may arrive almost together. When I first went to Raku, I was under the impression it was best to order just a few things at a time, but lately I've been told I might as well order everything at once.\n\n***The Atmosphere***\nRaku is fairly small, with seating for less than 50 people, plus 5 at the bar. It fills up quickly after opening time.\n\nRaku is also very plain - not in a bad way, so perhaps a better adjective is \"spare.\" The staff is Japanese; their English may be hard to understand, but they're polite and patient.\n\n***The Food***\nI've eaten at Raku a number of times, and have never been disappointed. Here are some highlights:\n**Home made tofu half & half. Even if you're not a huge tofu fan, order this. It can easily be shared by two or three people but, pig that I am, I always manage to finish it myself. The tofu is prepared two ways: (1) fried, in broth: a revelation! Great broth: rick, flavorful. Gently fried tofu amazingly had its own flavor.  (2) served fresh - creamy and tasty. Surprisingly good this way, especially with a dash of green tea salt or aged soy sauce. Overall, excellent. This was listed as a special, but has been available every time I asked.\n**Foie gras with glazed soy robatayaki. A large piece of liver, similar in taste and texture to seared foie gras. As you'd expect, delicious!\n**Soft custard omelet with scallop. It turned out to be a large portion of soft egg - vaguely like scrambled eggs, but with better flavor - in a small amount of strong but not salty broth. My description isn't the greatest, but the dish was very good.\n\n[---the items that follow are specials, but many of them seem to reappear---]\n**Blue fin tuna. 4 pieces standard type; 5 pieces toro (from collar instead of belly). Both were excellent; toro was especially good.\n**Live uni. Served in the shell, the roe was of course very good. Underneath was a broth flavored with more sea urchin, plus noodles and a little bit of salmon roe. Both tasty and fun.\n**Gindara saikyo yaki. This translates to grilled sablefish, but there seems to be some confusion in naming, so it's conceivable it might also be called black cod (although sablefish is not a true cod). In any case, it's mighty tasty! It consisted of a good size slice of firm, white, fatty (in a good way) fish, with a sweet glaze. If it's available, order it.\n**Whole unagi. Grilled. Half plain with sea salt (eat with soy and wasabi); half with bbq sauce. Better than normal.\n**Live soft shell crab. Prepared tempura style, the chef got it just right: a very thin layer of crispy batter, covering juicy and flavorful crab.\n**Ayu kanroni. A small-to-medium-fish, served whole, boiled in soy sauce, sugar and something else; eat the head, fins, skin, everything. Interesting - a bit sweet for my taste, but interesting.\n**Seafood with bonito guts. An assortment of diced raw fish, salmon roe, uni, and bonito guts. It was a little salty, but quite good - not nearly as exotic as it sounds.\n**Grilled yellowtail with ground yam. My first taste didn't seem special, but the more I ate the more I liked it. It was rich, and had a small amount of strongly flavored sauce. The ground yam was a good foil. Overall, it got a surprising very good rating.\n**Sawagani. 6 flash fried crabs. Tasty; a fun snack. So much better than Sushisamba!\n**Kodai. This might be a young porgy, but don't count on my translation. It was a small whole fish, deep fried, then served in broth; pretty plain. It won't knock your socks off, but if you want something simple, it's worth a try.\n**Grilled Kobe beef tongue. Obviously not true Kobe beef, but I'll save that rant for another day. It was very fatty, and only a little chewy. Odd, but good.\n\n***Summary***\nIf you haven't strayed far from sushi bars, Raku will be a new experience. Even more importantly, it offers some of the best Japanese food around. It's my favorite off-Strip restaurant, and is well worth the effort to get there. Reservations are a must.\n\n***The Bill***\nThe cost will vary dramatically, depending upon what you order, and how much you figure. If you're careful, you can spend $50 per person, plus drinks and tip. If you splurge, figure $75 - $100, or even more for the highest priced kaiseki meals.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw"}

Once we got seated, it took another 20 minutes for them to take our order then we waited another 20 mintues between appetizer and the main courses.  When my friend complained, the waitress responded by saying, \"I was trying to time it right,\" then proceeded to bring out the rest of the remaining dishes (all six of them) in one shot!  \n\nGratuity for a large group is automatically  added at 20%, so I got the impression that  they take no pride in taking care of their guests once you're seated.\n\nMy rankings are the following: \nService: one star\nFood: two 1/2 stars\n\nThe Chilean Sea Bass and the New York Strip steak were decent.  The potstickers were average.  The noodles and the XO string beans were over seasoned and soggy.  You can get better Chinese food elsewhere for 1/4 the price. We paid $57 per person.\n\nBottom line is you pay for the ambiance mostly at Tao, but the food is mediocre at best.

Whatever the case, the service was horribly slow..but just to me.\n\nSo if you aren't me and are on Western Ave. by Heinz field, you may want to check out this eatery.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Alk2AVNg3wTrI4L1d-krZw"}

He spends as much time with patients as they need. \n\nSo David S., should Dr. Weiner have an egg timer and start it at 15 minutes so that when your Grandmother's visit is over, he can dismiss her so that the next patient can be seen on time? Dr. Weiner probably spends more time with other patients rather than kicking them out of the room when their appointment is done.  And your solution makes little sense.  if he removes patient slots, that means your Grandmother wouldn't be seen today or probably this week. And his practice is a business like anything else; if they don't see a certain number of patients, they can't afford their overhead. And what do you think happens when a physician is on call with the E.R.? They are probably attending to a patient which means unforeseen events happen.\n\nDavid S.\n\nYes, he would go bankrupt if he scheduled patients according to your desired schedule. This is a medical practice not a barber shop. You cannot control every element in medicine. Unforeseen events happen. You can't compare it to a retail business.  Waiting for 100 minutes is not uncommon particularly with a surgeon who was taking call in an emergency department.  Many orthopaedic surgeons take trauma call. Should Dr. Weiner avoid repairing a shattered femur in an auto accident so that he can make you happy and be on time for your grandmother's visit? Did you ever consider why so many patients are willing to wait to see Dr. Weiner? There are plenty of orthopaedic surgeons in this city. Did it ever dawn on you that Dr. Weiner has an excellent reputation and patients are willing to wait to receive excellent care. Medicine is an art; replacing a knee is not the same as replacing your brakes. There are plenty of people who are willing to wait to receive excellent care. I would much rather be seen by someone who was late but then takes their time with my appointment than someone who kicks me out when my appointment is over.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wwbZGpfTUqzWMqetnJEvjg"}

I will emphasize the \"good\" and \"joint\" on this one because chances are even this little hole-in-the-wall will surprise you.\n\nI had seen the great reviews on Yelp as well as the Phoenix New Times about this place, so I decided to take a chance on grabbing lunch here on a Friday.  I was a little apprehensive about coming just because of the proximity to Moon Valley High School (it's literally next door).  Lunch + Friday + high school conjures up images of when I and hoards of classmates used to go to our favorite lunch spots with friends during high school.  Worse yet, the place is in a tiny old strip mall with almost no parking.\n\nShockingly, the place wasn't busy at all and I easily got a parking spot.  When you walk in you almost feel like you've stumbled upon an old convenience store as you immediately notice the soda machines, the large refrigerator area full of soda, and even the soda six packs on the shelves.  Notice a theme here?  Yeah, they've got A LOT of soda.  In fact they claim to have the widest variety of sodas to choose from in the state.  As in the entire state of Arizona!  I have no way of verifying this claim, but I did indeed see many soda brands and flavors I had never seen before from chocolate to watermelon, to lemon, and on and on.  If you're a soda junkie, you'll be in heaven here.\n\nBut I came for one reason, the burgers.  They actually have a variety of hot dogs, gyros, and submarine sandwiches as well, but its Rocket \"Burger\".  I saw one person eating a Rocket sized burger which is insanely huge (basically a submarine burger sandwich with at least 4 patties by my count).  I wasn't feeling that bold so I went with a bacon double cheeseburger instead and got a side of fries.  The burger was excellent.  Hearty portion with plenty of cheese and bacon and their special sauce (basically a rendition of thousand island from what I could tell).  The fries were pretty average so nothing special there.  All totaled, the burger, fries and a drink were $8.  The dining area is pretty small with tables, chairs and a couple of booth.  But like I said, it wasn't crowded and I was easily able to get a seat.  I was in and out in about 20 minutes\n\nOverall, a pretty cool place and certainly unique to the west side of town.  The fries were really the only big negative of this place.  Burger was great, prices are right, and the soda selection will blow your mind.", "type": "review", "business_id": "F8q_9PUl-Lwjj9xIRPArcg"}

The ambience is lovely and magical. Indoor seating is nice if you want that homey downtown vibe, as it is located in an old house with fun creaky floors and warm mood lighting. \n\nOutdoor seating is my personal favorite. I have always gone on weekend nights so there is sometimes live (but not overwhelming) music and quaint lights wrapped around the trees surrounding the tables. \n\nAnd as though the ambience wasn't enough, oh my god the food! My favorite pizza the is the diavla (spell?) which is a spicy salami pizza, and it tastes like what dreams are made of... The crust is crispy and the ingredients taste fresh! And the dessert! I HIGHLY recommend ANY crepes. They don't mess around. Fluffly and not to sweet, and always a perfect compliment to the nutella or fruit or vanilla ice cream. Honestly, they could probably put a pork chop in one of their crepes, and it would still be fantastic. Hahaha.\n\nPerfect date night or girls night out or a good \"show your parents from out of town an awesome place\" restaurant. \n\nOnly downside? The wait...

My goal was to find a place where we could have some great food and have fun eating!  \n\nUpon our arrival we were told it would be about 30 minutes so we went to the bar and got pitchers of their Sangria.  Excellent!  It was a dry red wine with fresh fruit as it should be not the sugary mix at all!  We were seated on the outdoor patio on a smallish round table and there were 5 of us!  We ordered and ordered and ordered...I think in all we had 20 different tapas!  Then the games began, the servers were bringing us plate after plate of tapas and as we devoured them they were there clearing the dirty plates.  It was so much fun!  I think we had a small army waiting on us because there were servers coming and going the entire time!  \n\nThe tapas were all outstanding!  I would list them but, just get the menu and pick out 20 of them and that should cover it.   We all enjoyed each and every one!  I got so full that I couldn't eat another bite.   All that food and the check was a mere $125!!!\n\nThe one negative about the Firefly is the noise level!!!! ouch...it is sooo loud!

I have also been a contractor for other services and have shopped at literally hundreds of Home Depots.  I would say as a whole Home Depot's service has taken a turn for the worst in the last 3-4 years but my last experience as this store broke the camels back and I will never shop at Home Depot again.  Not to mention I have 40 employees and countless friends I have shared and will continue to share my disatifaciton with.   Before I tell you the story first you must know I went to their competitor across the street and had all my issues immediately resolved.  (That DID NOT HELP)\n\nOk the story.  My last visit I was shopping for what supposed to be a quick project.  I was building a bath tub container out of PVC and other material so the kids could keep their bath toys in their and it would be interactive with knobs and dials ETC.  Now bear in mind I am District Manager for a retail chain so I have some degree of understanding and bias for what this experience should be.  So in tow I have a 1 year old and a 3 year old to go buy some misc pieces.  I get to the PVC aisle and first its a sloppy mess but its home depot so figures, but I can find maybe 60% of the parts I need.  I wasn't looking for plutonium here I need extremely common fittings.  I am confused, surely I am just missing them, so to my peril I try to find an employee......  HA even when I am staring at them they don't care to help.  So frustrated I decide I am going to go get the other components I need and come back to this section.  Bear in mind I spent over 20 minutes in one aisle with 2 kids.  So I proceed to walk the aisles, still looking for an employee, and I can't A.) find what I am looking for and B.) find a soul to acknowledge me.  Then it happens an employee talks to me YAY!  Not.  I am standing in the middle area kids in tow, cart full of other items I was planning to buy and this employee is walking in front of a pallet jack.  He looks at me and then rudely tells me to move out of the way and into the adjacent aisle.  So I scoot into the first part of the aisle but I am still hovering so he knows that I need some help.   But NO, he stops dead in his tracks and says \"move all the way into the aisle\".......\n\nLet me put this into perspective.  Over 30 minutes in this store, 2 small kids who are loosing their patience, a cart full of goods and the first person to talk to me tells me to get out of his way and then proceeds to hammer home the point by making a little scene.  Sure let me wait on you to do what your doing before I can pay for my goods which pays for your job......  Sure maybe that seems a little picky but this sort of experience is par for course at Home Depot.  I left the store, drove across the street and found all that I needed with the help of 2 different associates and was back in my car in 10 minutes.\n\nYou lost my business Home Depot.  The issues that plague HD are fixable but systemic and you can see they are consistent through their stores. (atleast here in phx)", "type": "review", "business_id": "j_wp7Qv7YMaqBsRZCpzrNQ"}

Yep that is the ticket. 2 great burgers hold the mediocre fries. \n\nDefinately reccomend you try this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cny9rhnhcYsJuTq2q4wp2A"}

The chef has traveled a lot, including to Jamaica, using his travels and sort of, let's say, meditative, spiritual beliefs to influence and bring passion to his food. All the people that work there are family or long-time friends.

The burger was delicious but the pot roast was simply incredible. I told the chef that his pot roast was so amazing that I'd like to see it slapped on a grilled cheese sandwich in the future. As the meal wound down, the chef delivered a small plate to the table with two little triangles of pot roast grilled cheese. As full as I already was, I didn't care. I downed the grilled cheese and just about died. I thought my perfect meal was over when the server surprised me with a birthday PB&J a la mode for dessert.

I went with a lunch special. Had the pasta carbonara and a small house salad. The salad was, well salad. The dressing was tasty and the greens were crisp. The pasta was wholesome, rich and loaded with smoked bacon, peas, mixed with creamy blends of cheese. it was very fulfilling. After eating a slice of bread or two and a wedge of quesadilla I could only eat about half my pasta before I was full. Baby had the Burger Melt. It sat on some sort of garlic parmesan bread, had lots of cheese and grilled onions, I had a bite. It was very big and intimidating, great if you like meat. The fries were crispy and and not overly salted. They told us about their fresh baked desserts which we didn't have the pleasure of trying. Now as to the best, yes I'm saving it for last. The Grand Lux Peach Bellini *moan moan moan* OMG, seriously orgasm in my mouth. I could taste the bubbly but it didn't overpower, had a slushy like consistency, a nice big amount of peaches and a big ripe red strawberry to top it all off. I could've drank ten. Best ten dollars I've spent in my life. So fruity and refreshing and just a burst of joy for my taste buds, I'm going back for a few more as soon as I can.

Heard good things about this place from the other mall employees, but was hesitant from reading all the other yelp reviews. I decided to give it a shot since my feet were looking a little sad. \n\nCame in during my lunch break and asked how long the wait was for a pedicure. The young man (maybe 15) said about 10 minutes. Ok fine. Went to get a smoothie in the mean time. They had the water ready for the pedi by the time I got back. \n\nOk here's where it gets weird. The young man I mentioned earlier starts to take off the polish from my toes. A little weird, but I just thought he was just prepping them for the actual nail tech. Nope!! He then goes to the lady next to me and starts to give her a massage. Um, first, he's 15. I don't really want a 15 year old boy touching my legs.  Second, why start the pedi if the actual nail tech isn't ready yet. \n\nThe actual pedicure was just ok. The bubbles were not turned on in the foot spa. I had black nail polish on before and then decided to go with French tip. All girls know that black nail polish is hard to take off. I noticed when I got home that there were still specks of black nail polish on the sides of my nail...mind you, visible through the French tip!!! He touched the nail polish a few times while he was painting. Seriously, I only had an hour for lunch so these mistakes added up. One star for the decent foot/leg rub. All this was done by the nail tech, not the 15 year old. \n\nThey all were busy with clients. I understand they want to get to everyone so they can make their money, but what happened to quality of work?! Does that not exist anymore?? \n\n2 stars for the massage and because they were nice people. I enjoy when they talk to me while getting a pedi. It takes away some of the awkwardness. \n\nAnyway I will not be returning to this place, even though it's a convenient location and is cheaper than my regular nail salon I frequent near my house. \n\n$30 for pedi with French tip...not a bad price.

After working in customer service for so long, nothing enrages me more than being on the receiving end of horrible customer service.  I received a coupon for a free medium beverage (ANY BEVERAGE) for my birthday.  Went through the drive-thru at the DD at 48th St. and Chandler Blvd. in Phoenix, AZ today during my lunch break.  Ordered a medium iced caramel swirl latte, because again, the coupon said ANY beverage.  The guy working at the drive-thru then asked if I was okay paying the difference.  I asked why, since the coupon said ANY beverage.  He then told me it was good on medium hot or iced coffee only.  I then asked why there was a picture of a latte, and he said \"that's a coffee.\"  I told him to turn it over, and he goes \"oh, that's just for promotional purposes.\"  I then told him I didn't think it was right that I had to pay the difference, since the coupon said ANY beverage, but I'll pay it anyway.  He then goes \"well, oh well.\"  Not SORRY for the inconvenience, or offering to have me speak with a manager.  Just \"oh well.\"  I paid the 88 cents and drove off.  Normally, I wouldn't get all worked up over 88 cents, but it's the principle of the matter.  Not only was I treated rudely, but if you're not going to honor your own coupon, then you're practicing false advertising.  I should've asked for a manager.  I also should've mentioned that I worked for a different local DD about 4 years ago and was poised to become an assistant manager before leaving because I was sick of working with jerks like the one who served me today.  Needless to say, I will never go to DD again.  I don't care if they're more expensive - I will gladly take my business to Starbuck's from now on.

Fortunately, we purchased the tickets at Tix 4 Tonight so they were discounted.  We never want to pay full price.  The seats were okay.  I didn't really like the setup of the theater.  The seating is by table and our table was about a foot wide so your date is next to you, which is fine (you can hold hands), but not too fine if you're not at the head of the table.  I had to sit behind a very tall man and had to keep moving from side to side to see the stage.  The performers themselves were good, not great.  I feel that the original Bee Gees had such effortless harmonies and these guys weren't as effortless (okay, okay, that's what my husband felt).

Heard about W6 because some friends used to live here. Despite their terrible comments on the management, I still thought about giving it a shot. But, I ABSOLUTELY REGRET making this decision. Tower two has more than 30 stories with three elevators; however, for 99% of the time, only two elevator works. 50% of the time, only ONE elevator works! It has been at least 5 days now with only one elevator working. If you need the elevator, you have to wait for at least 10minutes! \nFor some reason, there hasn't been hot water for a few days. Apparently some other units are experiencing no cold water, so I literally have no idea what is going on! \nYou can report a million times about different issues to the office and they'd say they will fix it, BUT they never or for the most, things get fixed after a week. \n\nThe walls between apartments are extremely thin (not much better from the ordinary dorm rooms). I can ALWAYS hear my neighbor's music! And being the unfortunate one, he plays music whenever he's at home. So, I pretty much know his schedule back to back now after a year of living here... If you are a dedicated full-time student, couples, or families that want somewhere peaceful to live in, THIS IS NOT A PLACE FOR YOU! \n\nVery lastly as a side note, If you are a PARTY ANIMAL, CIGARETTE OR WEED SMOKER, this is a place for you! Management team doesn't care about this place being a low-class apartment at all. It's pretty ironic because the apartment itself looks amazing and the rent is very expensive (which is suppose to mean that the quality of living should be great); however, the management and living lifestyle is terrible! \n\nThis is the worst apartment I have ever lived in!", "type": "review", "business_id": "tLVboBJy-Q0XW-Q6G_Yfmg"}

I work in the service industry, and it's not always easy to remain upbeat and happy, so I know how that goes. He's always on his A-game, though, and I find that he hires really good-hearted staff as well. They remember your drink if you go in regularly enough, and they're fast, but friendly...always ask you how your day is going. There's really something to that, ya know? And not just the generic \"how's your day?\" where the person couldn't care less, but an actual genuine question that they want to know the answer to. \n\nThe prices are great, right on par with a normal coffee shop pricing structure. You can get just about any coffee drink your little heart desires.\n\nThey recently remodeled so as to incorporate a barber shop at the front of the store. Not gonna lie, originally I was a little bit weary/skeptical of this idea. Wasn't sure how it would turn out, but honestly it looks REALLY nice, and I think once they build their clientele a bit more, it's gonna be awesome! It looks super clean and the space feels a lot larger than it did before actually. I don't usually hang out in coffee shops for extensive periods of time, maybe every once in a while I'll drop in and read a book or play around on my iPhone for an hour or two, but not extensive, like I said... so I don't think the smaller coffee shop space in back affects me greatly.

They bring some serious heat that gives a badass crunchy, chewy, cheesy, SPICY punch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BW52sBPn1Hbeh3LPsGLFtA"}

I received a call from her when she was able to finally get the chance to redeem her certificate. When she presented her gift certificate on check-out she discovered that it was several days expired. She had been extremely busy as a healthcare provider and new mother and had even taken her baby with her that day to get her nails done. She understood that she the certificate was expired, but tried to explain that she had been unable to use her certificate since she had not had much help with her child (now old enough at 6 months to be taken on errands) and had been working full time as well and to please allow her to redeem it as I had already paid for it. The associates refused, and she paid for the whole set. I called from the DC metro area to also beg them to please allow her to use it as it was only several days late and I had already paid for it and was told it was against policy. \n\nI have given this business 2 stars at this time due to their customer service. This is a rather new business, which would have received repeat business had they at least tried to work with her. Instead they received a free $35 from me for services which were not rendered. I do not need a refund and do not expect one. Rather, it would have been reasonable for the business owners to work with the customer in a difficult situation.

So you got people trying to eat while folks are hovering over them, talking and letting drops of saliva fly out....ok, i'll stop.

We wanted drinks and getting the pool waitress to help us was like pulling teeth so we got up and got them ourselves.\n\nSince we were on the 29th floor and overlooking the treasure show, it was loud! We could hear it clearly at 11:30PM which is one of the show times. But when you have kids, it wakes everyone up. \n\nMy one last complaint is the cigarette smoke in the casino. A few of the newer casinos filter that out so you cant smell it. They need to do the same. \n\nThe rate was very reasonable, but we reserved a block of a dozen rooms, but this takes you get what you pay for to a whole new level.

I always loved watching Emeril on television, and Table 10 was my ticket to actually taste his food. BAM!\n\nFirst of all, if you have any children two years old or younger that can't sit still, avoid bringing them to Table 10. While the prices, in my opinion, aren't that steep, this is a celebrity restaurant, dude! Would you bring a mentally unstable baboon to a fancy Jewish wedding? Please note : I'm not calling anyone's child (including my own) a mentally unstable baboon, and my child is not going to a fancy Jewish wedding.\n\nThe service was great (very attentive and properly mannered staff), the joint was spotless, and the food was borderline bodacious. My party of three went for lunch on a Friday, and we had no wait and a near empty dining room waiting for us. For just under 45 dollars (not including tip) we got a few complimentary bread rolls, a small pizza, pork po' boy with fries, and a Prosciutto Panini with a side salad. The six glasses of tap water I had were exceptional as well. Unlike the water they have on tap in New Orleans. \n\nI have not done the research, but even though Table 10 bears Emeril's name, I wouldn't doubt if the man himself hasn't even broken wind in his own restaurant. Hell, I'm just guessing, but Emeril Lagasse probably didn't even create the menu. Hey.... LEAVE THE GUY ALONE! HE'S A BUSY MAN CHOWING DOWN LOTS OF TASTY EATS AND SELLING FOOD ACCESSORIES ON TV! \n\nEven if Emeril had little to do with Table 10, I am proud to say that I ate at one of my favorite celebrity chef's restaurants. With the exception of an odd tasting pizza for an appetizer, Table 10 was a pleasant experience. When I go to Mc Donalds tomorrow (and three times a week for the rest of my life. I'm not proud of that.), I'm going to pretend my Mc Double is a Slow Cooked Pork Po' Boy from Table 10.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QozXMHqNzkVutP-FhcP30w"}

It is pretty darn good and about 10 levels higher in quality than Panda.\n\n1.  Ambiance - Located in a strip mall with easy parking and fighting for your food attention with a coffee shop and a sandwich shop near by.  You can smell the Chinese cooking and it get's your olfactory senses going.....  Inside, the restaurant is small, a few tables and quite crowded if there are people waiting in line.\n\n2.  Food - The quality of food here is quite good.\n\na.  Beef Chow Fun (Dry) - One of my favorite foods or comfort foods as my grandmother and mom always made this for me growing up.  I like the fact that this dish not only has al dente noodles, they do not fill up the dish with carrots and celery.  Veggies are important to the texture and the taste of the overall dish, yet using carrots and celery actually takes away from the taste of the dish vs. adding to the flavor.  Here they use green onion, onion, bean sprouts.  Very nice.\n\nb.  Chicken Curry - The flavor of the curry is a bit spicy, not too hot, just enough to get your juices kicking.  You won't need to grab lots or water, so rather it is a nice taste and flavor.  It is unfortunate that due to mostly western palate, that they use chicken breast instead of chicken on the bone.  The flavor of chicken on the bone is far superior to chicken breast.  However, they do slice the breast just right and flash cook it at the right speed so it is quite tender and juicy.\n\nc.  Spring Bean with Chicken - Love the flavor of the black bean mixed with this dish.  The spring beans are cooked to perfection and the chicken is flavorful and tender.\n\nd. Rice - They give you plenty of rice with your dishes.\n\ne.  Overall - All the food here is focused on western taste, yet all the cooks are Chinese short order cooks or so appear to be and yapping away in Chinese.  The cooks are all visible as you enter, so you can see everything.   They do catering here and pan sized dishes, so this is great for parties.  I don't vary much on what I order from here, because the menu is mostly western food, and not what I normally order.  However, for what I do order, it is great.\n\nI say check it out. You cannot go wrong.  This place is like going to Inn and Out for a burger vs. McDonalds.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eEazUUm1R_GcZa1r461qmw"}

I feel compelled to give my 2 cents worth.\n\nWe started out with jalapeno hushpuppies along with their remoulade.  The pups were very tasty (good start).\n\nFor our main course, we ordered the fried green tomato salad to share, my wife ordered the gumbo with a side of fried okra, and I ordered the fried catfish with double okra on the side.\n\nThe lag time between our pups and meal was LONG......outrageously long.  When they finally brought our meal, my wife didn't get her okra.  They explained that it would take a few more minutes.  Keep in mind, my plate had okra so I guess they must have forgot about hers.  It was no less than 10 minutes before they brought hers out.  \n\nWhen we finally received our meal the bartender apologized for the wait and explained that everything they have is fresh breaded and not frozen which is why it takes longer.  I can understand how fresh breaded takes longer but you should find a way to do it faster or take it off the menu if it's going to logjam your kitchen.\n\nAll this being said, even after the wait, if the food was good I would be writing a positive review right now.  The problem is, the food was just so so.  The okra had NO flavor and was not fully cooked to a nice crisp crust.  My catfish flavor was ok but the breading was pretty thick.  My wife's gumbo was a little bland....almost like the roux was a little weak. \n\nI really wanted to like this place.

I stayed in the jacuzzi suite and it was in need of a deep cleaning, you know that kind of clean where you set the room on fire and remodel it after the ashes settle. Ok so i paid $300 bucks to have a \"cabana\" by the pool on the fourth of july, When my girlfriend and I were shown our two lawn chairs located 2.5 feet from the kids wave pool, i was angrier than the time she  tricked into attending  Andrew Lloyd Webber's Opera, featuring such hits as: \"Don't cry for me argentina\". I said to the cute blonde bimbo in the bikini \"is this our cabana?\" she replied \"ummm lemme check, yeah.\" as if she was wearing an invisible ear piece connected to her manager. \n\n     At this point i didn't care anymore, I just wanted to catch a buzz and over eat. So the deal is you get the cabana for the day, but you need to eat up at least $300 dollars in food and drink. I asked the girl for a few water's and a few cocktails because it was already broiling hot. Oh man! it was over an hour later, How was i going to spend $300 if i couldn't get a water and a beer an hour? Another waitress walked by and I flagged her down to see if she could check on our drinks, she was gone like a gipsy in the hot vegas sun never to be seen again.\n\n   Now i know what you are thinking , \"well it was the fourth and they were really busy\".....\"um, no\" they weren't busy at all, we were surrounded by empty chairs and splashing little kids in the wave pool. So we eventually got our drinks and quickly finished them because we thought we were going to evaporate on our redneck lawn chairs that were settled on a awkward slope by THE KITTY POOL!!!!!!, Long miserable story, but in the end we complained about the lack of service and received some lame hundred dollar credit for the next time we want to starve for a buzz and some snacks next to the pee pee pool. \n\n     The kicker is that the waitress tried to take an included gratuity of $80 dollars hahahahah, I didn't even know who she was and she tried to take almost a hundred bucks from me. Her manager called her over right in front of me and my girlfriend, making her peel open that  baby blue fanny pack and fork over the dough!!!! hahaha VICTORY!!! never again Mr. Monte Carlo!!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ripCiWZ0MblMZSLrIKQAKA"}

I'd stay here again, but if you're looking for Vegas extravagance where you're immersed in the hotel theme down to the detail, look elsewhere.\n\nRoom Tip: Some rooms are quite far from the elevators - if you have mobility limitations or fear the long walk an impossible chore after an evening of drink, request one close by!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HMr_KN63f6MzM9h8Wije3Q"}

They have a great pool area to relax in, and I somehow manage to forget my bathing suit 70% of the time.\nEveryone here offers you water - drink it!  Not only are you in the desert, but massages can be intense for your body, seriously, drink extra water.\nTry the signature facial - it is pricey ($145) but you get a facial PLUS a hot stone massage for your arms and legs while the goop on your face is sinking in - so it is a facial and a massage in one.  It is by far my favorite treatment here - I think I caught myself snoring at one point.  Plus, my skin looks *amazing* - all dewy and pretty.\nThe hot stone body massage is also fantastic - the full version of the hot stone treatment.

My feet are so pretty!\nBeware, the cafe closes at 3 pm, so if your treatment is ending after that, you will be grouchy and hungry (ahem, like me).  Try some of the tasty spa food before 3 pm - you will be glad!\nIs it expensive?  Absolutely.  Is it worth it?  If you are someone who enjoys being pampered and feeling like royalty for a day, absolutely.\nAnd boys, if you have a lady in your life, put down the blender/coffee maker/vacuum cleaner you were planning on getting her for a gift and splurge on a spa day gift certificate.

You are free to bring your camera and take photos.

So after several times of doing this, I was told something about a \"power hour\" where they wont take calls. This was very strange to me but I went along with it and called 2 hours later instead. AGAIN I was faced with the same responses of \"Shes in a meeting\". \n\nSo finally I decided to ask if there was anyone, ANYONE else I could work with because it is very inconvenient that Im constantly told the same thing every time I call and am getting no assistance.

Of course they will do the standard procedure of \"I can take a message if you like.\" But whats the point if they NEVER get back to you. As I even stated to the receptionist. I am glad I see their true colors now, reading over other reviews AND even statements from the job I had which others received from Appleone also.

What a horrible tribute to Elvis Presley, one of my all time favorite artists.  I grew up listening to Elvis because my mom is a big fan of his music so I was extremely excited to get a hold of some tickets with such good seats.  Boy, was I in for a surprise.  I don't really want to go into detail without giving it away for those who still want to see it, but don't expect too much acrobatics and don't count on much of a WOW factor either.  This show lacks any depth and I really felt like they took some things from other cirque shows, manipulated it a bit, and tried to tie in a little historical/biographical/musical testament to Elvis.  It was a complete fail and some of the acts made me think, \"WTF is going on?!?!  Why is this bit in here??!? How is this even relevant?!??  When is this shit going to end!!!??  F-ing ridiculous!!!\".  Not surprisingly, I fell asleep periodically throughout the show.  I was ready to leave before it ended and felt like it was a waste of my life- how sad is that?!?!\n\nWhatever, I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone, Elvis fan or not, and I would suggest you save your money and go see another show.  Fortunately for me I didn't pay for my tickets!!!  I would've been damn regretful if I had though.  On a brighter tip: the auditorium is really big and nice.  You can tell they invested a lot of money in this.  Costumes were colorful and somewhat interesting to see.  Lastly, they did play some of his classics that I loved listening to.  \n\nCirque, I hope you came on yelp and really take these reviews to heart.  \n\nand....\n\nElvis, I apologize on behalf of Cirque for portraying you in such an atrocious fashion; what a slap in the face!!!

NB Tae Kwon Do is an amazing place.  It is run by two brothers and their mother.  The vibe here is community.  \n\nI am not an expert at Tae Kwon Do but I am a master parent.  My son was 4 1/2 when he started and had a horrible temper and enjoyed hitting his sister.  My son has been coming here close to six months now and he doesn't hit his sister and is a much better student at school.  What more could I say?  If I read my testimony I would ask, \"Where do I sign?\"  The walls and counters are filled with trophies and childrens report cards, letter from teachers etc.  i am not sure how the adult classes are but most of the adult students are incredibly active here in the childrens classes.  They also appear to be capable to kicking my butt.\n\nChildren arrive early to class with smiles on their faces and leave late to play with the other children.  The parents have been so welcoming of me and are incredibly friendly to talk to.  The classes have set times but the instructors do not end class until they are confident the kids got what they came to learn.  I like that.\n\nOverall, this is the spot if you are interested in getting your kids in martial arts.  In a way, I owe them my sanity.  I was unable to control my sons negative attitude.  Having him come 2-3 times a week for class has taught him so much more than I could.  Kudos to NB!  We will be lifetime members.", "type": "review", "business_id": "b4lzS1FzmzKctCb2js3iBQ"}

Man kann hier tats\u00e4chlich noch mit leeren Gl\u00e4sern so lange sitzen wie man will, ohne dass man rausgen\u00f6tigt wird.\nBesonders hervorzuheben ist das Essen. Es ist nicht von der Stange sondern lebt. Es schmeckt immer alles anders als beim letzten mal und anders als man es erwarten w\u00fcrde, aber immer total lecker.

Tempting as it was, I choose their chopped salad with salmon sausage on top. Even though salmon sausage sounds kind of funny, it made for a flavorful dish!

The first simply set silverware down and without looking at either myself or my husband uttered 'your server will grab your drinks' and walked away. Almost ten minutes later, our server walks up and had my husband not been looking up, since I was buried in the menu, neither of us would've noticed her standing there since she didn't greet us. She takes our drink requests without a smile or any additional interaction and walks away. Our order for food followed soon after but our simple breakfast took over 30 minutes to  arrive, the saving grace of the experience was the delicious onion & green pepper potatoes!

I always do reviews before I travel to see the most up to date info.\n\nReview is for our family of 4 doing a long weekend getaway July 3-6.\nGirls are 13 and 10.  Pretty mature for their ages, love to travel....we knew kids in Vegas was going to be a bit tricky so a little more planning on this one.  \n\nI've stayed at many hotels and admit I'm getting spoiled.  Monte Carlo came to be not because it rivals the Bellagio dripping in luxury (seriously go VIP at the Bellagio, it rocks.) BUT I needed a good location and most important a really great pool for the kids.  Monte Carlo does it right in the pool area.\n\nCheck in: Don't fear the line, they move it well.  It was a breeze and everyone was very friendly.   I've never tried the $20 sandwich trick or even just bribing for an upgrade but I was talking about how happy I was to finally get to the hotel after a 3hr flight delay and as we wrapped up he upgraded me to a higher floor.  Very nice.  I tipped just because he was so nice to work with and that was a great gesture after long travel. \n\nRoom: Good, not great.  I've seen some pics from other reviewers and I knew what to expect.  Amenities are fine, space is fine.  My only issue is the beds and pillows.  I can't get a good night sleep here.  On the firm side which I don't normally mind, but just...not good.  Housekeeping ladies are awesome.  Monte Carlo gets a HUGE Plus for having in room coffee and 2 bottle waters daily.  Wifi isn't great though and I have Verizon....only get one bar in the room.  Busy holiday weekend and we didn't even experience any noise from other guests.\n\nDining: You can see the list of what they have but I can say when you need to get something relatively inexpensive, it doesn't get any better.  Of course McD and Subway prices are a bit jacked up but I also didn't hike/drive to get to them.  Great range of dining in the hotel  Before the Blue Man Group we took a chance on Dragon Noodle (see my reviews on each of those) and it was AWESOME.\n\nHotel: Layout is so smart.  From check in, elevators are close saving a trek through the casino.  Pool is super easy to get to, near the elevators.  Food court is near by too.  Most manageable layout for a strip hotel and make it a great choice for families.\n\nPool:  LOVE.  Crowd ranges and ...well you see it all.  Come as you are, you'll fit in.  Show your key, they check for glass in bags.  Small shop has essentials and if you want a cold beer w/o having to wait (or tip) you can get it here like grabbing a soda.  TIP: you can rent inner-tubes to use in the main pool or lazy river OR bring your own, buy in the gift shop or ABC store.  They will inflate anything you have.  For our 3 day stay we bought 2 med ones for $12 each in the gift shop.  Deal.   Food prices are on par for Vegas. Service this busy weekend has been great.\n\nLazy river, wave pool and main pool, volleyball court w sand.....many places for beverages and BONUS, free water cooler (watermelon infused) so you can stay hydrated. Only one bathroom area though.  DJ at the top of the wave pool area starts at noon, so fun.  No drinks in wave pool or lazy river.  All seating gone by 9am, no joke. Clears out some by noon. \n\nCabanas: 3 styles and unlike some hotels where the high rollers get first crack and pricing is obscure...this is easy but reserve in ADVANCE!  We knew this was prime time to hit the pool and I wanted one day where we didn't have to stress over seating.  \n\nOnly 8 full cabanas, near lazy river/wave pool.  TIP: Do not get #8 unless you get a deal, it is by the bathrooms and on a walkway, worst location ever.\nThey have about 11 lazy river day beds, 2 with pergola like things so you can use curtains to shield. Include a fun queen sz bed with 2 lounge chairs, towels, 2 tubes.  Or, the basic which we got, and it is so fun...umbrella with the bed and 2 lounge chairs.  Service is awesome and attentive.  \n\nTIP: For the cost of the rental, you can apply ALL food and bev charges towards that.  Family of 4?  I should be able to do that by noon lol.  Husband was gonna hit Starbucks and I tripped him walking away,  no way, we are eating at the cabana ONLY today!! That is a deal.  I did not get that offer at Bellagio or Caesars cabanas.  FYI we paid top pricing for saturday on the holiday weekend, so $400, plus they add 18% gratuity and tip.  Well spent IMO.  If no one has rented by noon I heard you can \"make an offer\" too.\n\nHotel Location: Great. My little one isn't a fan of walking and the 13yr old can shop 24/7.   This is perfect.\n\nRecap: I researched for days and days to make this trip work for kids.  Top 3 hotels for families are consistently MGM, Mandalay and Monte Carlo.  This one for price, amenities and location win IMO.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ripCiWZ0MblMZSLrIKQAKA"}

If you think you know Thai food, only order from the part of the menu with the northern specialties.  It's Thai, but it's nothing you'll recognize unless you're really well traveled and know Thai food extremely well.\n\nEat. Here. Now.  If you say you don't like Thai food, eat here anyway.  If you don't like it here, then I will allow you to say you don't like Thai food -- but not until then!", "type": "review", "business_id": "lliksv-tglfUz1T3B3vgvA"}

A little something green would have been nice on the dish too, like parsley or chives to brighten it up a bit.\n\nThe steak medallion dish was decent.  Nothing to write home about, it came on a pad of mashed potatoes and a few stalks of asparagus that they cooked the hell out of.

WTF. \n\nF&E has a very reasonable price of $1.99.. on the pillsbury brand.. on the reduced fat variety. A miracle I tell you ! I was shocked to find they even had the all the quirky items on my shopping list (velveeta) in such a small store . \n\nLastly props to them for all the awesome fresh prepared options they had. Although I have yet to try them for myself, they did look quite tasty and had a great lineup of options (pesto pasta with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella for $2.99 anyone?)\n\nI walked away so impressed this might be the place I start doing 90% of my grocery shopping.

Despite that, I encourage anybody interested in martial arts lessons to do some research before going here. Luckily, they don't have you sign a contract or push you into testing for higher ranks. When I first joined, I didn't want to join their demonstrations group, but that changed during October of my first year. It was fun while it lasted, but unfortunately, I decided to withdraw from the demo groups b/c of words exchanged and issues with favoritism.\n\n I wanted to pursue further into lion dancing, but all that has changed and those teachings were for nothing. We had an instructor from Hawaii teaching advanced lion dance techniques, but his teachings were thrown away like it's nothing. I wanted to advance, but despite my dedication, I was denied that oppurtunity b/c I wasn't \"good enough.\" Yet, some of those who came after me was already doing things I wanted to pursue.\n\n  What ruined my experience with the demonstrations team was two of the senior students who degraded me right of front of others, especially when I mess up in a public demonstration. Those two used their ranks as a way to bully me around. Yet, they talked to everyone else like they're friends with one another. If you're not connected with their group or a high rank, then you have no say.\n\n My seniority wasn't respected and those who came after were treated as if they had seniority over me, my dedication to go further was ignored and I resigned from there. I felt miserable being there and had to tell the grand master and his son who is a sifu that I had to make that decison. I knew they were counting on me b/c of my abilities, but with what I encountered, I had to leave the demo group.\n\n I would give this school 2 1/2 stars, but this rating system won't let me. Nothing wrong with taking lessons martial arts wise, but I'd recommend thinking twice before participating in their demonstrations. \n\n The only thing that's keeping me on going is just the main class which is the traditional kungfu classes they have and I'd recommend that if you're looking for something on the traditional side. Lion dancing isn't my thing anymore, even when I'm at a demonstration performance, I'm just helping out  and I'd rather prefer focusing on the martial aspect instead instead of lion dancing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5axuPqS0jXatFVLljQvQPw"}

This place has a lot of employees. This place has a lot of employees that won't help you unless you are going to help their commission. \n\nHowever, I have been lucky and on my last visit, even though I was purchasing a very small and very inexpensive TV I was catered by a gentleman that treated me like any customer would want to be treated. I only wished I remembered his name now. \n\nThey match Internet pricing but be careful with price matching with Amazon. I have had them try to be tricky and say that can't match prices because it is not sold by amazon, just listed on amazon. Trickery, I tell you.\n\nOn a bright note, they almost always have what I want or need.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UIhFRsZoPTWY38njcKKWiw"}

No wonder they've been voted as the Madison's #1 fish-fry favorites year after year. Call ahead and make a reservation if you are planning to go for the Friday affair. The place is literally packed. My friend and I got lucky and was seated at the nice booth seat right next to the bar. While waiting for our food to come, we got to watch locals enjoying themselves at the bar. My bloody marry was a perfect accompaniment to the cod. I think my friend enjoyed his martini and perch as well.  The food is excellent, the service is excellent, and it's got the homey atmosphere - I have nothing to complain about this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aP9wnNPiOIWCyk27ZTeRqQ"}
